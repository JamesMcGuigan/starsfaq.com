<font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+3>Cluster Carnage</font></font></h1></center>
<font color="#FFFF00">Host: <a href="mailto:spectrum@pipcom.com">Dave Johnston</a></font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cluster carnage will be a
game between 4 mature civilizations, each with their own</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">clearly defined territory, battling for possession
of an equally well defined 'no mans land.'</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Host will be playing, and
game will run on autohost.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -One turn per day, seven days
a week.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I'm aiming for a Nov 1 start
date.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I am looking for 3 more players,
and a volunteer to set up the universe.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I am thinking of banning
IT, as it's gating advantage would be magnified in this game, but am willing
to listen to arguments either way.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Player requirements: I'm looking for advanced
or expert players.&nbsp; You must have won a PBEM game at higher than beginner
level if you want to join, and be experienced in Nubian design/counterdesign..</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">The game will take place in a custom universe,
shaped with 'Universe Creator' using an image that looks like this:</font>
<br><img SRC="five.jpg" height=434 width=434>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homeworlds will be adjusted
as required so that each players HW (and secondary world, if any) is in
its own 'corner cluster', and nobody is in the center.&nbsp; Each players
space consists of about 30 planets, with 8 or so in the center circle.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to their home
clusters, each player will be assigned several planets in the center cluster
that they are allowed to colonize or mine. (see 'Universe creation guidelines'
below).&nbsp; Players may negotiate trades among the center stars if they
wish, but no invasions are allowed.&nbsp; Planets trading hands must be
evacuated and recolonized.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first turn, you must:</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-delete the designs of any armed or minelaying
ships you start with.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-Send your scout on the shortest possible looping
path that completely encloses all the worlds in both your home cluster
and the center cluster.&nbsp; This defines your 'area of operation'.&nbsp;
You must not send any ship or mineral packet outside this area for the
duration of the build up period.&nbsp; Note that the scout may be given
orders to visit every planet in the area before making this loop; it is
not important that the ship actually fly the loop, just that the path be
readily visible so nobody has any doubt about where they can and cannot
go.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game will then proceed
with 10 turns of 20 years each.&nbsp; During this time:</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -no armed ships or minelayers
may be built.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -No unassigned center
planets may be colonized or remote mined.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 2600 on, turns go back
to the usual one year per turn per day.&nbsp; In the year 2600, minelayers
may be built, but not armed ships.&nbsp; From 2601 on, you may build whatever
you like.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victory conditions:</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To win the game, a player
must either:</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-Own all planets in both their home cluster and
the center cluster.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OR</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-Own 40% of the universe, including ALL of the
planets in their home cluster, and at least two planets in each of the
other 4 clusters.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one of these conditions
is met, the player will email his password and turn file to all other players
with a declaration of victory.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No team wins allowed.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victory cannot be declared
before the year 2620.(20 years after regular play begins)</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Universe Creation Guidelines:</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am looking for a Stars!
type person who doesn't want to play, but is willing to set up the universe.&nbsp;
The following are the guidelines I will ask them to follow.&nbsp; The volunteer
will keep generating until a universe is created that meets the following
criteria.&nbsp; They are open for discussion if a player has a suggestion
as to how they might be improved.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -All planets are within the
white areas as shown on the bitmap.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Each players home (and secondary,
if any) worlds are alone in their own corner cluster.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -The largest home cluster
is no more than 3 stars larger than the smallest home cluster</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Each player will be assigned
roughly 1/4 of the stars in the center cluster.&nbsp; A player with fewer
stars in his home cluster may be given a bonus star in the center, or a
player with more stars in the home cluster may be given one less.&nbsp;
The player with the most center stars will have no more than 1 star more
than the player with the fewest center stars.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -It is possible that not all
center stars will be assigned.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -It is possible that not all
players will have exactly the same number of planets to start.&nbsp; It
is understood that all Stars! games have an element of luck in the setup,
and holding out for the perfect game setup could place too heavy a burden
on our generous setup volunteer.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Sound good?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are interested in playing,
please <a href="mailto:spectrum@pipcom.com" email>email me</a>.&nbsp; If
you are unknown to me, please include a brief history of your Stars! career.&nbsp;
Do not send race files.&nbsp; Once a setup volunteer has been found, I
will have you send race files and passwords directly to them.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will probably also like
to get a feel for the universe setup, and test out potential races.&nbsp;
If so, you'll want to download:</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<a href="http://gray.ucom.dp.ua/dstars/">Universe
Creator</a> (yes, I know the site is in russian.&nbsp; If you scroll down
in the left hand frame, however, you will find a download link in English.)</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -a copy of the actual bimap
used to create the universe, and an example of the type of universe we
will use; get files <a href="cluster.zip">here</a></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Actually, though the cluster
sizes are identical on the bitmap, some clusters in the altered map are
consistently smaller than others.&nbsp; A little tweaking on the bitmap
will probably be required to make an even playing field.&nbsp; This shouldn't
affect your testbeds, however.)</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a universe with the
following characteristics:</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Difficulty level: Standard</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size: Small</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Density: Normal</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Player Positions: Distant</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accelerated BBS start</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Random Events</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now start the universe creator.&nbsp;
Set it up as follows:</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Template file: carnage.bmp</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensetivity: 2</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free space mode NOT checked</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Min dist. between stars: 17</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Universe size: small</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'max search' box checked.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xy selection: test.xy, or
whatever you called the test game you just set up.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit generate.&nbsp; Sometimes,
generation fails, or the resulting universe has stars outside the designated
areas.&nbsp; If so, generate again until you get a nice 'clean' map.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go back to your stars game
and reload the turn to see the new universe layout.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Notes on moving stars:</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Universe creator allows one
to move stars about on the map, subject to one major constraint.&nbsp;
While star positions may be changed, the left-to-right order in which the
stars occur cannot change.&nbsp; This is a constraint built in to the game.xy
file itself.&nbsp; In practice, what this means is that while a star may
be shifted up or down as one desires, the left-to-right position can hardly
be changed at all.&nbsp; For our purposes, a star can be moved between
upper and lower clusters, but not between left and right clusters.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note that the map, as
diplayed by Universe Creator, is a vertical reflection of the map as shown
by stars.&nbsp; The UC author assures me that this oversight is due to
be changed in the next version.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once UC has generated a map,
the person setting up the universe (hereafter called "God"), must verify
that :</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">1) there are two races in the left hand clusters,
and two in the right hand clusters.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">2) there are approximately the same number of
planets in the left two clusters as in the right two clusters.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If both these are true, then
a suitable map may be created from the initial setup.&nbsp; Otherwise,
God must run UC again in hopes of a more amenable setup.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a suitable map has been
found, God must make a list of what planets need to be moved up or down,
from one cluster to another, in order to isolate players homeworlds and
assure a fairly even distribution of planets.&nbsp; God will then go back
to UC and:</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-select 'change'</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-in the 'change' window, click '+', to initiate
a list of planets to be moved.&nbsp; The UC asks for homeworlds, but in
fact any planets may be moved.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-from the dropdown list, select the name of a
planet to be moved.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-click on 'ins' to add the planet to the list.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-repeat these two steps until all planets to
be shifted are listed.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-Click on "Next".&nbsp; A blue vertical line
will appear on the UC map screen, passing through the first selected planet.&nbsp;
Don't forget the mirror image: stars that the Stars! game show to be in
the upper clusters appear in the lower clusters on the UC screen, and vice
versa.&nbsp; Move the cursor over the blue line, and it becomes a crosshair.&nbsp;
Select the spot on the line to shift the planet to, and click to move the
planet to that location.&nbsp; You will then be shown another vertical
blue line, for the next planet to be moved.&nbsp; Repeat the above procedure
until all planets that need moving have been moved.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">-Go back to the stars game and reload the turns.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">In one sample universe I created, it took two
tries to find a suitable universe (3 HW's on the left in the first try),
and about 15 minutes total to set things up.&nbsp; The most time consuming
portion was counting the stars in the individual clusters.&nbsp; After
several attempts, I found the best way to be sure of counting all planets
and not counting any twice was to count the clicks as each planet in a
cluster was added as a waypoint for a scout.</font>
