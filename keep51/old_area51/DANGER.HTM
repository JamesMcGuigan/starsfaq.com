<p>Here's a game with a twist!&nbsp; The universe will be created with
'Universe Creator', using the bitmap below:
<br><img SRC="nebulae.JPG" height=400 width=400>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the stars will lie in the white areas.&nbsp;
The black circles will each be filled by speedbump and detonating normal
minefields.&nbsp; These fields will be replenished as fast as they decay
(and explode) so that their size will remain constant.&nbsp; These fields
may not be swept under any circumstances! they are to be considered static
obstacles.&nbsp; You are welcome to fly through the 'danger zones' if you
wish, but I don't think you'll find it a pleasant experience.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the game will run as usual.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -No SS races (they would gain an unfair advantage
by leeching research from the host during the buildup)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Up to 15 players
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Universe size/density depends on number of players.&nbsp;
I aim for about 30 to 40 stars per race.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -BBS start, No random events (ever have your HW
hit by a meteor during buildup?)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -pop and surface minerals will be returned to year
2400 levels before play commences.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Victory may be claimed by an alliance of at most
2 players.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -No pre-game alliances
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Game will be played on autohost, generating every
24 hours, 7 days a week.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Game is open to all skill levels.&nbsp; However,
if you want in, you must have previously played a PBEM Stars! game to its
conclusion (ie: you played until somebody won, or you were dead)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<a href="dangerzone.zip">Download</a> a sample
universe to see how it will look
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Send race files or questions to <a href="mailto:spectrum@pipcom.com">Dave
Johnston</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will this be done?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All races will be submitted without passwords (host
is not playing).&nbsp; The host controls a '1 world wonder' SD race.&nbsp;
The first turn, I will set everybody's production queue to 'alchemy as
needed' so that no reasearch or building will occur, and record everybodys
population and surface mineral levels.&nbsp; Ar races will have starbases
dowgraded to space forts, to limit pop and thus reduce mineral concentration
depletion.&nbsp; I will then pre-generate as many turns as required to
allow me to research, build, and position the minelayers, and then another
50 years or so to let the fields build to their steady state size.&nbsp;
I will then return everybodys pop and mineral levels to their year 2400
values,&nbsp; re-build AR starbases, distribute the turns, and play will
commence.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea is to have the game start with everybody
in the same position as if there had been no forced gen.&nbsp; If anybody
see's any loopholes in my plan, please bring them to my attention.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The host race will have everybody set to neutral.&nbsp;
ALL players MUST have the host race set to friend for the duration of the
game, and NEVER have a battle order that targets 'everybody'.&nbsp; This
is the only way to prevent deliberate or inadvertent sweeping of the hosts
minefields.&nbsp; If you screw up and sweep even a single mine, you will
be subject to a 5 turn suspension.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hosts homeworld is off limits to everybody,
and his ships may never be attacked.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tip: you may want to outline nearby danger zones
with a ship path, as they will appear on scanners as friendly minefields,
though in fact they are decidedly unfriendly!
