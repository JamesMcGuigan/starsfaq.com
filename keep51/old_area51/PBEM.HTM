		<ul>
		<li> PBEM
			<ul>
			<li> What is PBEM
				<ul>
				PBEM stands for Play By E-Mail. In Stars! it is used to refer to the method of playing whereby each player is sends and receives their turn files by e-mail. PBEMs are usually played at a rate of 1 turn each day or every few days, and thus the game will be stretched over a period of several months.
					<br><br>
					This method has several advantages:
					<ul>
					<li>Players don't have to be online at the same time to play
					<li>Players can fit taking their turns into their own schedule
					<li>The pace of turns means players can take as long as they like over their turns
					<li>Diplomacy can play a big part as the timescales allow for discussion among players
					</ul>		<br>

			<li type="disc"> Game Setup
				<ul>
				<li>If the game is to be played on <a href="http://library.southern.edu/stars/stars.htm">Autohost<a> then you should e-mail <a href="mailto:autohost@library.southern.edu">Ron Miller<a> and let him know you wish to reserve / queue a spot.
				<li>All the players send the host their race files (<a href="fileinfo.htm#gamefile">racename.r1<a>) for the particular game.
				<li>The host generates a new game, either using the stars program or from the <a href="command.htm">command line<a> using a <a href="def.htm">*.def<a> file.
				<li>If the universe is to be re-mapped or there are other scenario setup then the host does this.
				<li>If the game is to be played on <a href="http://library.southern.edu/stars/stars.htm">Autohost<a> then the files should be submitted (<a href="http://library.southern.edu/stars/gamesnew.htm">click here for details<a>).
				<li>For <a href="http://library.southern.edu/stars/stars.htm">Autohost<a> games just let the players know the url of your game page when it is ready.
				<li>The host sends each player a copy of the universe definition file (<a href="def.htm">gamename.xy<a>).
				</ul><br>
				For games hosted maunally the procedure is as follows:
				<ul>
				<li>The host sends each player their turn file (<a href="fileinfo#gamename">gamename.m5<a> goes to player #5 and so on).
				<li>The players take their turns and the host waits for them to return their submitted turn files (<a href="fileinfo#gamename">gamename.x1<a>)
				<li>The host generates a new turn using the host file (<a href="fileinfo#gamename">gamename.hst<a>), this can be done before all players have submitted.
				<li>The above steps are repeated for each new turn.
				</ul>
			</ul><br>

			<li> How to find new PBEMs to join.
				<ul>
				<li>Most new PBEM games are posted to <a href="news:rec.games.computer.stars">rec.games.computer.stars<a>
				<li><a href="mailto:xdude@scanpost.com">X-Dude<a> specialises in huge "monster" 16 player games, see <a href="http://www.computersims.com/stars/">his site<a> for details, (not recommended for beginners)
				<li>Glen Hibbard (AKA Mr Stars!) maintains "the list", which is an e-mail mailing detailing all the new PBEMs that where posted to the NG during the day or sent to him direct. Send a blank e-mail to <a href="mailto:stars-sn-games-subscribe@yahoogroups.com"> stars-sn-games-subscribe@yahoogroups.com<a> to subscribe

<a NAME="#Blitz">
				</ul><br><br>

			<li> What is Blitz
				<ul type="disc">Blitz style play is where the game is played online in semi-realtime, new turns are usually generated every 5 minutes.

								<br><br>
					This method has several advantages:
					<ul>
					<li>Often multi-year generations are used where the players only submit for every 4th or 5th year (ie 2400, 2404, 2408, 2412 etc)
					<li>Blitz style games are usually played in tiny universe and occasionally a small, but very, very rarely on a medium+ size universe.
					<li>Blitz style games usually last several hours and played in a single stint.
					<li>Diplomacy is very brief, as the lack of time and pace of game don't allow time for big negotiations.
					</ul><br>
			<li>Where To Find
				<ul>
				Using an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client, (such as <a href="http://www.mirc.com">mIRC<a>), log onto one of the following servers:
				<ul>
				<b>Starlink.org</b>
				<ul>
				<li>Denver.CO.US.StarLink.Org
				<li>Glen.VC.AU.StarLink.Org
				<li>WichitaFalls.TX.US.StarLink.Org
				<li>SanJose.CA.US.StarLink.Org
				<li>Detroit.MI.US.StarLink.Org
				<li>Stockholm.SE.EU.StarLink.Org
				<li>CricInfo.LO.UK.Starlink.Org
				<li>WeAreTheB.org
				</ul></ul><br>
				Then log onto the chat room <b>#stars!</b><br>
				If you have any difficulty transferring files using mIRC, then ask the other players present for assistance.<br><br>
				Note: The #stars! chat room is a *lot* less active than in previous times, so if no one responds its likely everyone is busy doing other things.
