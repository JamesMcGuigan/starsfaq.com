Notes:<br>
The J patch downloads are exe files and replace your existing stars.exe file. The I patch download is a self extracting installer. Which will overwrite your  existing stars.exe. If you wish to keep several patch versions of stars on your computer then simply rename the stars.exe files (e.g. stars-i.exe, stars-j3.exe). Though you will have to update any shortcuts or files associations pointing to the .exe file. v2.7 and v2.6 are 100% compatible (if running with the same patch version). The only difference between them is that 2.6 doesn't have any sound, and thus doesn't require the wavemix.dll. So if you don't have this file, or are having problems with the sound, then use 2.6.<br>
<br>
These patches are not compatible with each other. So all players in the game must be using the same patch. Also races created in one patch cannot be used in games using another patch.<br>
<br>
Please note though that you will need a stars serial number to use these files (the same serial will work on any patch/version). See section 1.4 for information on acquiring one.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.1 - What is the purpose of this FAQ?<br>
<br>
This FAQ is intended to answer some of the most frequent questions asked on this NG, and to give people some vital info that players need to know.<br>
<br>
This FAQ will usually be posted to the NG on the 11th and 26th of each month.<br>
<br>
If I have missed anything, got something wrong or have any suggestions then let me know.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.2 - What is rec.games.computer.stars?<br>
<br>
Rec.games.computer.stars (rgcs), is a discussion forum (AKA newsgroup) dedicated to discussing the games Stars, and the various tactics, strategies, theories, game mechanics involved in the game, or anything else that could possibly be considered related to the game.<br>
<br>
There are no set rules on this NG, and you may say whatever you wish. But this having been said, it is not advisable to just start flaming or insulting people for the sake of it. And if you do come across trolls or flamers then it may be best to just ignore them. This NG is actually quite pleasant if you treat it's members with a little respect.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.3 - What is Stars?<br>
<br>
Stars! is an Advanced Interstellar Strategy Game and a member of 4x genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) of PC games. It was written by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride with help from Jeffrey Krauss (collectively known as the Jeffs). It was originally written in 1995 and is still as fun to play now as it ever was.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.4 - Where can I get Stars?<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this game is become quite hard to find, but there is a solution. You can order online from Empire Interactive, or over the phone from Stockmann's.<br>
<br>
Stockmann<br>
<br>
You can simply buy the serial number from Stockmann (taken from an unopened box), over the phone/e-mail with a credit card and download the files themselves from the internet (see 0.0 Where do I get the J patch - you will want v2.6 JRC3).<br>
<br>
The cost is 6.55 Euros, which coverts into UK: &#163;3.93 or US: $5.50 - (Currency rates correct of 25.11.00) <br>
Though they can ship the box or just the CD, ordering the serial is by far the quickest and cheapest method.<br>
<br>

Email: <a href="mailto:tuomas.seijavuori@stockmann.fi">tuomas.seijavuori@stockmann.fi<a><br>
<br>
Ask for either Tuomas Seijavuori or Eino Palin both of whom have been stars enthusiasts for many years<br>
<br>
Stockmann is open weekdays 9am to 9pm, and Saturdays 9am to 6pm. But please note that they are based in Finland (but all speak English), so are GMT+2h.<br>
US central time is GMT -6 (1am to 1pm)<br>
<br>
(US time zones are: Eastern GMT-5 | Central GMT-6 | Mountain GMT-7 | Pacific GMT-8 hours | UK is GMT+0)<br>

present in the game. The URL is <a href="http://www.starsfaq.com/advFAQ/">http://www.starsfaq.com/advFAQ/<a><br>
<br>
<br>
1.6 - What is considered on topic?<br>
<br>
On topic postings include:<br>
<br>
Announcements of new Stars! games that require players, or games in progress requiring replacement players (The title of such a post may be prefixed<br>
with: &quot;NEW GAME:&quot; or &quot;REPLACEMENT:&quot;).<br>
<br>
Strategies/tactics for playing the game<br>
<br>
Questions regarding the game mechanics<br>
<br>
Suggestions, comments and queries about Stars! Supernova Genesis (Just don't ask when it is coming out) (Prefix with SN: or SSNG:)<br>
<br>

<br>
Anything else that could be considered related to the game Stars.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.7 - Tips on what not to post<br>
<br>
Questions:<br>
Asking where you can get a free copy of a Stars serial number. Most of the members of this NG don't condone piracy of our favourite game, especially now that there is an easy way to obtain the game legally (see 1.4 for details).<br>
<br>
Asking when is Stars!: Supernova Genesis (SSNG) coming out. This question has been asked so many times that it is not funny any more. There has been no official date set of it's release, and will take as long it takes to be finished. The game is currently in beta testing, and Q1 2001 is being taken as a guideline for it's release, though this is far from certain. Also rumour has it that Mare Cirsium delays the release date by two weeks for every time someone asks &quot;when will it be released?&quot;.<br>
<br>
See <a href="http://crisium.com">http://crisium.com<a> for more details on SSNG.<br>
<br>
Spam:<br>
Any mass posting about commercial products or web sites not related to Stars! is considered spam. Though unwelcome on this NG, there is in reality very little that can be done to stop spammers, as even if they do eventually get kicked of their ISP, they can quite easily get another account.<br>
<br>
Spammers do not read replies to their spam. So flaming them is pointless. And some members of the NG can get annoyed if you reply to a spam message. Though it has led in the past with some interesting OT discussions with rec.games.computer.ultima.dragons, who are sometimes on the same spam list.<br>
<br>
Binaries and HTML:<br>
This is a non-binaries NG, and as such binaries and HTML are not welcome.<br>
<br>
Binaries are files attached to a post, and they can be significantly larger than a plain text post. HTML posts (Hyper Text Markup Language) consists two attachments, one of the plain text and another of the HTML itself, so unnecessary duplication takes up more space. Some newsreaders don't support HTML posts and don't allow users to download binaries.<br>
<br>
Many people still have slow internet connections and pay per minute to the phone company for internet access. Larger posts = longer to download = hard earned money.<br>
<br>
Also there is only so much space on the rgcs server, so it deletes old posts to make room for the new, but large files and HTML will take up extra space that could be used to keep other older posts on the server for longer.<br>
<br>
Off Topic Posts (abbreviated OT):<br>
Off topic posts are anything not directly related to the game Stars!. Though we don't generally mind about OT posts and threads, try not to allow them to become too long. OT threads should be prefixed with OT: If you do post OT then also try to balance your OT posts with on topic posts.<br>
<br>
Don't flame/insult people:<br>
If you think flaming people is fun and makes you look cool, then think again. It's not cool; most of the members of rgcs will cease to take you seriously, and probably flame you back and/or killfile you.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.8 - What are few tips for posting on the NG?<br>
<br>
Please lurk.<br>
If you are new to the NG please lurk for a while before you post - it will help you a feel for the NG and not make a fool of yourself on your first post.<br>
<br>
Read the FAQ<br>
Well I guess if your reading this, I don't need to tell you :-)<br>
<br>
Use &lt;snip&gt;.<br>
For space reasons and for easy reading please snip out irrelevant points to the discussion when replying, especially if the post in question is a long one. Also if you leave a blank line between the text you are replying to and your reply, it makes it easier for others to read and follow.<br>
<br>
Give credit where credit is due.<br>
<br>
And above all have fun!<br>
<br>
<br>

Notes:<br>
The J patch downloads are exe files and replace your existing stars.exe file. The I patch download is a self extracting installer. Which will overwrite your existing stars.exe. If you wish to keep several patch versions of stars on your computer then simply rename the stars.exe files (eg stars-i.exe, stars-j3.exe). Though you will have to update any shortcuts or files associations pointing to the .exe file.<br>
<br>
v2.7 and v2.6 are 100% compatible (if running with the same patch version). The only difference between them is that 2.6 doesn't have any sound, and thus doesn't require the wavemix.dll. So if you don't have this file, or are having problems with the sound, then use 2.6.<br>
<br>
These patches are not compatible with each other. So all players in the game must use the same patch. Also races created in one patch cannot be used in games using another patch.<br>
<br>
Please note though that you will need a stars serial number to use these files (the same serial will work on any patch/version). See section 1.4 for information on acquiring one.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.3 - I want to play multi-player--where is a good place to find a game?<br>
<br>
Most new games are posted to the NG so this is a good place to look<br>
<br>
For a digested version of these game posts and some others, subscribe to &quot;The List,&quot; maintained by Glen Hibbard, AKA Mr. Stars. This is an e-mail list, and will be sent out daily (but only if there are new games to mention)<br>

If you want to play in a huge/packed game (not recommended for first timers) then contact Xdude as he organizes several of these monster games at a time. His site contains a list of the games he will be hosting. But be warned, these games will require a *lot* of commitment.<br>

Or you could always host your own game, and post it up to the NG.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.4 - A few tips on new game posts<br>
<br>
The most important things to mention when advertising for a new game are:<br>
<br>
Name of the game (&quot;New Game&quot; isn't good enough)<br>
Patch version (if other than J-RC3)<br>
Universe size and density<br>
Number of players<br>
Skill level - be specific<br>
Game setup options (AccBBS, PPS etc)<br>
Turn Generation Schedule (i.e. 24h)<br>
Victory conditions (e.g. Vote & # of races in winning alliance) Submission<br>
method (ie autohost or manual)<br>
Any special rules that apply to this game<br>
Contact Details (i.e. e-mail address)<br>
These are the most important things to consider, and they will affect<br>
game play so have a think about them first.<br>
<br>
Universe size/density and player numbers all affect number of planets per player (see advanced FAQ for # planets per uni-setup). Less planets per player means war will break out sooner, and the game will be over sooner. A large number of planets per player will mean longer and slower games. If you are not sure, then aim for about 30-40 planets per player (beginner games tend to have a much higher rate of dropouts than higher level games, especially in larger games so you might want to allow for an extra 25% - 40% drop out rate during the game).<br>
<br>
Large differences in player's skill can easily spoil a game. The difference between intermediate and beginner is so large that it is ill-advised to mix them. It may also be useful to check that players who apply are of the right skill level for the game.<br>
<br>
Most of the game setup options are largely down to player/host preference. And with the exception of slow tech, won't have a massive effect on game play.<br>
<br>
If you host on Autohost then you might wish to increase the timer by a few hours (i.e. use 27h for daily gens), as this gives the last player a last player to submit a bit of leeway, and stops the gen time from rolling forward. Games usually take 3-4 months to complete if played on a daily generation schedule.<br>
<br>
Special conditions such as banned races, pre-genned or re-mapped universes should be clearly mentioned. Also, though it is usually considered default (better safe than sorry though), you should mention if things like the SS bug cheat and other &quot;bugs/features&quot; are allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
3.1 - Known Bugs in Stars JRC3<br>
<br>
Race File Corruption:<br>
If you edit the race name in a race file can cause the file to become corrupt. This is especially common when making the race name shorter than before. To get around this, when editing the race name, either edit it one letter at a time (saving and re-opening each time) or copy the race data into a new file by hand.<br>
<br>
Random Race:<br>
If at any point during the race creation you select random race but then de-select it, it can cause the race to generate a random race every time you use it to play a game with. This is because the random tag within the file is not unselected. Though it has been reported by others, I did a recent test of this, but could not activate it.<br>
<br>
32k Ship Limit Per Fleet:<br>
There is a limit of 32k of any one type of ship in a fleet (32,767 to be precise). If you try and merge two fleets together which would push the ship count over this limit (i.e. a fleet with 25k chaff and another with 10k), stars has a few problems. If done manually, the ship type will disappear from the fleet readout, but re-appear in the next generation (you will only lose ships in excess of the 32k). But if done using the &quot;merge with fleet&quot; waypoint order, all the ships of that type will disappear. This is because when the integer (16 bit - signed) holding the number of ships goes over the 32k limit it becomes negative, and as you can't have a negative number of ships, it reads as 0.<br>
<br>
There are also some other limits in the game: 512 separate fleets, 512 separate minefields, 16 ship designs, 10 starbase designs, 256 tokens at a battle. The game will not allow you to exceed these limits.<br>
<br>
<br>
3.2 - Copy Protection Features<br>
<br>
The copy protection in stars is a little unusual. Each turn file you submit to the host is stamped with 2 codes. The first is your stars serial code (the one it asked you to enter when you installed the game) and a computer hardware code (this is a code based on all your hardware - it changes whenever you alter your hardware settings [formatting a second hard drive will do it]). These codes are recorded in the x files, which are overwritten every time you &quot;save and submit&quot;<br>
<br>
When the host generates a new turn, stars checks all of these codes. Copy protection will kick in if it spots 2 or more codes which have the same serial code, but a different hardware code. It doesn't keep a record of these codes from turn to turn, and only checks the codes for the files for the current turn. And when copy protection kicks in, it affects all turn files with the same serial code. Copy protection basically messes up your turn (half growth rate, lowered production, fleet orders cancelled and some ships scrapped)<br>
<br>
This means that you can use the same code to:<br>
Play in the same game both at home and at work.<br>
Play several races in the same game from the same computer.<br>
Play on your friends computer with your code.<br>
Play with your friend(s) using the same computer.<br>
Continue playing a game on a different machine.<br>
Play two separate games on 2 different computers at the same time with the same code.<br>
<br>
Though times when the copy protection can kick in:<br>
If you give your code to someone else and then try and play in the same game as them without using the same computer for turns.<br>
If you are playing two races (or helping an ally with his turn) and do the &quot;save and submit&quot; on two different computers (with same serial #) the copy protection will kick in.<br>
If you are playing two races and do one turn, but you change your hardware config before doing the second turn (it will ask you to re-enter your serial code when you load up stars), this will also kick in the copy protection.<br>
<br>
To get round this problem, you will have to open up both/all your turns on the same computer and then do a &quot;save and submit&quot; on them all before (re-)submitting them to the host.<br>
<br>
<br>
3.3 - Game &quot;features&quot; / &quot;bugs&quot; of JRC3<br>
<br>
There are several &quot;features&quot; of JRC3 which the making use of may be<br>
considered cheating in your games. Though if in doubt check with your host.<br>
<br>
Chaff:<br>
The game mechanics will cap the kills inflicted by missiles to the number of missiles fired (i.e. one missile = one kill). Also the targeting algorithm favours weakly armoured targets (in relation to cost in res and bor). These two facts can be taken advantage of. The cheapest armed ship you can build is a scout or frigate with an x-ray laser and QJ5 engine. If you build 1000's of these, the enemy's missiles will target these first. The problem is that the targeting algorithm doesn't take into consideration the fact that to kill a frigate with an Armageddon missile is actually wasting 1005 points of damage in overkill. So with enough chaff you can effectively nullify the enemies missile firepower. But note that the &quot;one missile = one kill rule&quot; doesn't apply to beams, so beamers will eat through chaff very quickly. This is considered a legitimate tactic in most games, though you do find the occasional game in which is banned.<br>
<br>
Split Fleet Dodge:<br>
An attacking fleet can only attack ships at the same location. If you split your fleet into many smaller individual fleets and diverge their movement orders, an attacking fleet can only engage one of  them (the one with the largest mass will be targeted - though there may be a bug with this). A change was made in the JRC3 patch to stop multiple chasing fleets from all attacking the same target when this was done.<br>
<br>
UR/CE Scrapping:<br>
Races with CE get half price engines, and races with UR get to reclaim up to 90% of resources and 70% of minerals that went into the ship/fleet. However when scrapping at another races starbase, Stars doesn't take into account the fact that CE races get half price engines and the resources given are based on the full amount. A ship that is mostly engine (scout with pricey engine), can be used between an alliance to generate &quot;free&quot; resources and minerals. This has been partially countered now that gifted or alien ship (i.e. not built by that race) are considered 30% cheaper in working out scrapping.<br>
<br>
Battle Board Overload:<br>
The battle board can only handle a maximum of 128 tokens per player (256 / # of races present). Excess tokens are simply left out of the battle. The tokens selected are based on fleet number, so the 128 lowest numbered tokens would fight and the other left out. This can be taken advantage of by splitting off 129 chaff (or other cheap ship type), doing a split all on the 129 chaff fleet and then merging the rest of the fleet with the highest numbered ship. This would allow you to &quot;dodge&quot; the battle for the price of 128 chaff. Or simply keep some of more vulnerable ships out of battle (i.e. bombers and freighters). Most players would consider the deliberate use of this to be &quot;cheating&quot; unless specified by the host prior.<br>
<br>
0.2% Minimum Damage:<br>
Stars records damage to armour in a fleet/stack as in 1/512ths (0.2%). Any shots in combat (that do armour damage) will be rounded up to the next 1/512th of the total armour in the stack. Normally this isn't an issue, but can be abused. By Building 100+ DDs or nubs with alpha/beta torps, and splitting them into individual fleets just before combat, you will fire a very large amount of slavos (100 fleets of nubs with 9 slots each with beta torps = 900 salvos). Normally these would only do a little bit of damage, but because they are all individual salvos they will each do 0.2% damage, and with 900 slavos that is 180% damage. Which would kill one enemy token/stack outright and damage another by 80%, and this is per round of shooting. The number of missiles per slot won't increase the damage, but having 2 or 3 in the slot will give you a second or third chance to make that salvo hit (missed missiles don't damage armour). Note that shields aren't calculated this way. And the 0.2% rule doesn't override the one missile = one kill rule, so when the stack is at 99% damage you will still need one missle per ship to do the killing blow. The best counter tactics for this are first to split up your fleet into several smaller tokens (thus it will only kill part of your fleet), and to have gatling armed beam ships (as they do damage to each token in range).<br>
<br>
False Public Player Scores:<br>
Stars calculated actual resources during the middle of the generation, but calculates resources displayed in public player scores at the very end of the turn. This can be taken advantage of, by uploading pop from each of your planets using waypoint 1 orders (i.e. after movement) and then dropping them back as a waypoint 0 order (ie before movement). This doesn't affect actual output, but can significantly lower your reported resource output from which your score is largely based. This could prevent other players realizing that you are running away with the lead (and thus ganging up on you) until it is too late. Though this could backfire if you are caught, as other players would know that you are hiding something so may to gang up to stop you (which is exactly what you are trying to prevent).<br>
<br>
North/South Minefield Immunity:<br>
There is an unusual bug in which there are no minefield hit checks done do a fleet traveling exactly due north or due south. Though the checks are carried out if there is even 1ly of east/west movement. This could allow a player to travel through a minefield at warp 10 with a 0% chance of hitting a mine. Most players would consider deliberate use of this bug to be &quot;cheating&quot;.<br>
<br>
SS Pop Steal:<br>
The robber baron scanner can steal minerals from an enemy player, though a player cannot usually steal enemy colonists. Though in the J patch, the check for seeing if the player wishes to steal enemy colonists was disabled when using the waypoint 1 task option (Transport|colonists|load all). This was not intended. This bug has been proved to unbalance the game when used. Most if not all players would consider use of this bug to be &quot;cheating&quot; unless &quot;specifically&quot; stated by the host prior the start of the game.<br>
<br>
Free Pop Hack:<br>
Using a memory editing utility it is possible to create colonists out of thin air, limited by a players freighter capacity. This abuses a lack of a viability check for an event not cannot be caused through the usual user interface, and only with the help of an external memory editor. Though I do not believe that this hack can be used to create minerals, only colonists. Use of this in a multiplayer game would be considered by most players to be a totally inexcusable cheating offence.<br>

<br>
Population Death from overcrowding:<br>
0.04% per % over 100% cap.<br>
Thus a 200% cap planet is 100% over and thus has (0.04 * 100 = 4%) a 4%<br>
death rate. This maxes out at 400% capacity at 12%<br>

Exact Minefield Damage:<br>
500 (600) * # engines per ship [use ship type with most] - 100 (125) per missing engine (ie fleet of 1 nub [3 engines] and 3 DDs [1 engine = 2 less than a nub] = (500 * 3) - (100 * 6) = 900 damage )<br>
Damage is spread equally among all ships, regardless of # of engines.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
100 (125) * total # of engines in the fleet (damage is based on # engines<br>
each ship has)<br>
<br>
Use the formula that does the most damage, the break point is usually 5 ships in a fleet. If any of the ships in the fleet has a ramscoop engine (including the Enigma Pulser) then use the numbers in parentheses (). These figures are for standard minefields, substitute 2000 (2500) and 500 (600) instead for heavy minefields.<br>

<br>
Deflectors:<br>
Due to the way stars rounds the calculations for deflectors, they give slightly more protection than the 0.9^def formula would indicate, especially on designs with large numbers of deflectors (12+)<br>
<br>
Overgating Damage:<br>
<br>
Additive Damage:<br>
Any damage suffered through overgating is added to any existing damage. So a 75% damaged ship, suffering 25% damage will be at 100% damage and thus die. It is also possible due to rounding, that a ship could suffer 100% damage from extreme overgating, and thus die this way even if it starts as undamaged.<br>
<br>
Distance Overgating (Safe mass):<br>
1% for every 4% beyond the safe distance, starting at 104%. For ships significantly below the safe mass, the damage suffered will be slightly less (as little as 0.96 * expected damage as above).<br>
<br>
Mass overgating:<br>
(square root of (N / S)) -1 = damage sustained<br>
<br>
where N is the actual mass of the ship, and S is the safe mass. This formula is accurate to within 2% of actual damage for all ship masses between the safe mass and 3.5 x safe mass. Above 3.5 x safe mass, expect to take between 85% and 100% damage.<br>
<br>
Losing ships to the void:<br>
It's extremely variable, but losses average to around 33% at maximum overgate range for a ship of safe mass, and appear to be roughly linear in relation to overgate distance. Similarly, losses from mass overgating seem to peak at around 33% for the maximum overgate mass, when gating a safe distance. However, always bear in mind that if the damage sustained would take the ship to &gt;99% damage, you will lose the ship every time, regardless of anything else.<br>
<br>
None of the above applies to IT ofc, who will only lose ships to the void when they sustain 100% or more damage.<br>
