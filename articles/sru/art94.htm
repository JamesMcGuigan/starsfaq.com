Race design level strategies<br><br>

-f/~f/!f - Factoryless race  (There are variants with
          extremely expensive factories.)<br>
HG   -     Hyper Growth  (A race - often HE - designed for
          population explosion, 1/1000 pop eff, average factory
          settings ~11/9/16 or better maybe.  See QS below.)<br>
HP    -    Hyper Producer  (A race designed for high resources,
          but often slower growth, 1/2500 pop eff, 15/7/20+ facs,
          or thereabouts.)<br>
HR     -   hyper-resource  (Not often used, sometimes called
          Quickstarts/hybrids with HG pop off and HP fac settings.
          See QS, and use it preferably.)<br>
NF      -  (uncommon) see -f above<br>
QS       - Quickstart  (See HR above.)<br><br><br>


Hosting, gameplay, and race wizard<br><br>

Other Non-standard acronyms in the Stars! newsgroup<br><br>

1/2 ... -  like "1/1000 11/9/16/3g 10/3/15" shows
          race design economy settings:<br>
          - resources produced per colonist;<br>
          - factory efficiency (resources produced per factory),
            factory cost (in resources),
            number of factories operable per 10,000 colonists,
            germanium cost of a factory (3 or 4);<br>
          - mine efficiency, cost and number operable.<br>
          (There are variations on how the germanium
          cost is shown. Sometimes instead of 3g or 4g, people use
          g-box or no g-box, to indicate 3 or 4, respectively.)<br>
1/2/3... - with six numbers, like "10/16/9/12/11/7", shows
          the technology research levels attained by a race:<br>
          energy, weapons, propulsion, construction,
          electrical, biotechnology<br>
ly   -     lightyear<br>
MM    -    Micro Management
          (having to take care of lots of details each turn) <br>
MT     -   Mystery Trader<br>
tech    -  technology<br>
TMND     - The Monster/Menace Next Door (uncommon)
          (You wouldn't like him so close.)<br><br><br>

RL     -   real life<br>
RTFM   -   read the f... manual<br>
WTF    -   What the f...<br>
YMMV   -   your mileage may vary - implies that
          the reader might get a different result or
