<h3>Kill Ratios for Bombing<br>
by: Thomas Pfister</h3>

<p>I´ll try to explain how bombs/defenses exact work.<br><br>

<h4>1) Defense coverage.</h4>

<p>Each Defense type has a specific base defense coverage, that is
the value of Defense coverage _ONE_ Defense gives:<br><br>

SDI     d=0.99%<br>
Missile d=1.99%<br>
Laser   d=2.39%<br>
Planet  d=2.99%<br>
Neutron d=3.79%<br><br>

The coverage of more then one Defense is calculated<br><br>

Def(base)=1-((1-d)^n), while n is the number of Defenses.<br><br>

e.g. 100 Neutron-Defs:<br><br>

=1-((1-3.79%)^100)<br>
=1-((1-0.0379)^100)<br>
=1-(0.9621^100)<br>
=1-0.0208)<br>
=0.9792<br>
= 97.92%<br><br>

<p>This is the coverage versus normal Bombs like cherrys and versus
packets and meant killing Pop.<br><br>

Versus buildings the Defense coverage is halfed:<br><br>

Def(build)=Def(base)*.5<br><br>

e.g. versus 100 Neutron Defs:<br><br>

= 97.92% *.5<br>
= 48.96%<br><br>

Versus invasions the coverage is 75%<br><br>

Def(inv)=Def(base)*.75<br><br>

e.g. versus 100 Neutron Defs:<br><br>

= 97.92 * .75<br>
= 73.44<br><br>

Versus smart bombs the coverage is calculated the following<br><br>

Def(smart)=1-((1-(d/2))^n)<br><br>

e.g. versus 100 Neutron defs:<br><br>

= 1-((1-(3.79%/2))^100)<br>
= 1-((1-(1.895%))^100)<br>
= 1-((1-0.01895)^100)<br>
= 1-((0.98105)^100)<br>
= 1-(14.76)<br>
= 0.8524<br>
= 85.24%<br><br>

<h4>2) Normal Bombs</h4>

Normal Bombs works linear, that means<br><br>

Pop_Kills(normal)=sum (kill_bomb_type(n)*#(n)) * (1-Def(base))<br><br>

e.g. 10 Cherry(2.5%) + 5 M70(1.2%) vs 100 Neutron Defs (97.92%)<br><br>

= Sum (2.5% * 10; 1.2%  *5) * (1-97.92%)<br>
= SUM (25% ; 6%) * 2.08%<br>
= 31% * 2.08 %<br>
= 0.31 * 0.0208<br>
= 0.00868<br>
= 0.868% of planetary Pop will be killed<br><br>

Destroy_Build = sum (destroy_build_type(n)*#(n))  *(1-Def(build))<br><br>

e.g. 10 Cherry(10 buildings) + 5 M 70(6 buildings) vs 100 Neutron Defs<br><br>

= sum (10*10; 5*6) * (1-(97.92%/2))<br>
= sum (100;30) * (1-(48.96%))<br>
= 130 * (1-0.4896)<br>
= 130 * 0.5104<br>
= ~66 Buildings will be destroyed.<br><br>

If you increase the number of bombs the bombing result will increase linear.<br><br>

<h4>3) Smart Bombs</h4>

Doesnt work linear, the kills will be:<br><br>

Pop_kill(smart)= (1-Def(smart))-(1-Def(smart)* ((1-smart_type_1)^n1) *
1-smart_type_2)^n2)....)<br><br>

e.g. 10 Annihilators(7%) + 5 neutron (2.2%) vs. 100
Neutron-Defs(Def(smart(=85,24%)))<br><br>

= (1-85.24%)- (1-85.24%) * ((1-7%)^10) * ((1-2.2%)^5))<br>
= (1-0.8524) -(1-0.8524) * ((1-0.07)^10) * ((1-0.022)^5))<br>
= 0.1476 - (0.1476 * (0.93^10) * (0.978^5))<br>
= 0.1476 - (0.1476 * 0.484  * 0.895)<br>
= 0.1476 - 0.0543<br>
= 0.0933<br>
= 9.33% of planetary Pop will be killed.<br><br>

<p>As the second term (which gives at least 0.0543) goes versus zero if
the number of bombs increase, the maximum kills will be the first term
(14.76%) with high Bomb numbers, but with 100 Annihiltaors it will be
already very near this value. So with planetary Pop say around 350.000
and a high growth rate say >16% it is impossible to bomb a planet out
with smart bombs, as the pop growth is anyway higher then the kills
from Bombing.<br><br>

Hope this is helpful and explains how Bombs/Defs works.<br><br>

I've spun up a spreadsheet with Thomas' formulae - Data for all bombs
and defences are already in it (except MCM which I can't remember off
hand).<br><br>

Just put in the number and type of defences, number and type of bombs
(up to 8 different bombs supported) and it gives you expected kills,
minimum kill (for standard bombs) and installations destroyed.<br><br>
