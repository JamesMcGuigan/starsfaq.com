<h3>Minesweeping Exploding SD fields<br>
by: Jason Cawley</h3>

<p>>      What I've done is create a purpose built minesweeper on a Frigate <br>
> hull type. A JOAT minesweeper with 3 Gatlings is a very effective and <br>
> inexpensive minesweeper, since you don't have to put in a sensor suite( <br>
> eg. no extra minerals, or resources to use). I've used it the 2nd time <Br>

<p>Frigates don't work too well against SD minefields that blow up - because you either give up shielding (thus passing up on a way to halve the armor damage taken) or have so little armor every hit kills the ship. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Is the general idea of cheap sweepers a good one?  Yes - even to the point of using just one gatling, the frigate hull, and a cheap ramscoop engine.  Very cheap - so cheap you can have as many as you want, really (the 512 fleet limit is more important than the cost) - but they don't work against exploding fields.  Against non-SD mines they are great - for SD races especially (the two extra free warps - a DNA scanner if you really need it).  But if a single ship is going to take 500-600 damage every turn it is sweeping, the problem is not so easily solved. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Then you might want 5 ships, that have some shielding - like a DD with a shield in the general slot, or a cruiser (a bit expensive, but they can form up to fight).  Without ramscoops and with a fuelxport or base somewhere behind them, clear of mines (to repair damage when needed, and refuel if necessary). <br><br>

</p>

<p>The problem then is skirmishing.  The cheap frigates one can use as throwaway ships, replacing them as fast as they are destroyed (since the limit is #fleets, not expense, in any meaningful way).  But when your sweepers are 5 DDs or 5 cruisers, the attrition losses from enemy intercepts are not quite so easily made good.  And if the "package" is predictable, they are easily killed without loss by a total force that may well be smaller (e.g. 100 sweepers in 20 groups of 5; interceptors 5 groups of ten each - result: in four years, all sweepers dead and all interceptors intact - *if* the sweepers are predictable). <br><br>

</p>

<p>So for the sake of efficient skirmishing, the #'s per fleet must vary and some fighting ability helps.  Skirmishing works best with battlefleet support, too (which the other guy will have as well). <br><br>

</p>

<p>One might try to get around this with one-use ships that could take one mine hit alone, using them like the cheap frigates - but I doubt it will work very well (more expensive, and gone real soon without much effort by the other guy). <br><br>

</p>

<p>So, realistically, against a good SD player of approximately equal power and exploding fields, one needs unpredictable and imaginative skirmishing, with relatively expensive ships.  IMO. <br><br>

Sincerely, <br><br>
