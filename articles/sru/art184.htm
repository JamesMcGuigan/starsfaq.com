<H3>Moen’s Tips for New Players<br>
By: David Moen</h3><p>

Editor’s Note: This article was written as tips for beginners in a game David Moen was mentoring.<br>
<ul>
<li> The tips were included on selected turns by the host with the covering
  message that accompanied the .m  file sent to the players in the
  game "A Third Small Step".
<li> This was a game intended for people who had never completed a game against
  humans before, had PPS, no AccBBS, and Max Minerals, a tech 10 ceiling and
  was 80 turns long. Players were restricted to using one of the 6 canned
races.
<li> The tips may not be appropriate for all other situations.
<li> The tips are presented in the order they were given. On some turns,
especially later in the game, no tip was given.
</ul>

<hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Things to do and not do on the first turn of a Stars! game:
<p>- Move all your ships with scanning ability, plus any mining ships,
to scout nearby planets. Feel free to give orders for several years
of movement. Your longest range scout ship (the one with a fuel tank)
should be given a course to scout the planets that come close to a
straight line between your home world and the farthest system in the
universe. Mining ships will scout a planet on the year they first
mine it. They should be used on nearby planets that won't be on the
paths of scouts you build later. Shorter range scouts should be given
a course that has them scouting several planets and ends at a system
you would like to get continual reports about for some time. Transports
with scanners should be given a course to scout local planets and then
return to base.
<p>- Set your production queue(s) for your planet(s). A good queue
should have auto build factories at the top. Only auto build mines when
you have run out of minerals for factories and defenses. One possible
production queues is:
<ul>
<li>auto build 500 factories
<li>auto build 100 defenses
<li>auto build 500 mines
<li>auto build 100 terraform
</ul>
<p>Once you have a queue you like, set it as the default queue.
<p>- Look through the Others' Fleets Summary Report (hit <F3> three times
to see this report. Get used to looking at this for any early contacts
with other races.
<p>- Set up your research. At the beginning of the game, it is probably
best to set the percentage of resources used to 0. Do set the current
and subsequent field values, so that any unexpected surplus resources
you happen to get in a few turns will be spent in the right place. If
you don't have Improved Fuel Efficiency and enough Propulsion tech to
build either the Fuel Mizer engine or the Daddy Long Legs 7 engine, you
might want to consider starting your research in the Propulsion field.
You will need good engines to move your population around once you
have enough people on your home world. Generally, adjustments to research
should be the last thing you do each turn, so changes in population and
production arising from your manual loading and unloading of ships, and
changes to production queues, don't cause an unexpected drop in research.
<p>- Don't build new ships. You need to re-invest all you’re output into
your economy, building factories and mines.
<p>- Don't send silly messages to all the other players. People will judge
you by what you say, so don't say anything that will give a bad impression.
Consider saying nothing at all until you meet someone, or until you have
something important to discuss with the universe.
<p>- Don't start colonizing other planets immediately. If you can, wait
until your planet's population has reached 25% of capacity before moving
population off of it. You economy will grow faster this way. Sometimes
you may need to move some population before you reach 25% of capacity,
but this would be in response to something another player is doing.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Most races grow their economy fastest if they don't send any population
away from their home world until it has reached 25% of population capacity.
However, once they reach that point they continue to grow fastest by not
letting the HW population grow larger than that. They control the population
by shipping it to new colonies. To do this efficiently they must be
prepared to move colonists efficiently as soon as they reach 25% of
capacity. Preparation includes having fast capacious transport and having
found worlds to settle. This usually means researching Construction and/or
Propulsion tech to get a reasonable freighter design, and building more
scouts to find habitable planets. However, all of this work should be
delayed as late as possible, so as to minimize the cost to economic growth.
It matters _when_ you make an expenditure because of the compounding
effects of growth.
<p>To figure out when to do research or when to build scouts, you have to
figure out how long it will take to get the work done and count backwards
from the year you will need it.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>The year before you surpass 25% of population capacity on your HW, you
should put into the production queue enough transports to move the population
you will have in excess of 25% of capacity. The transports should
probably be based on the privateer hull with three fuel tanks and an
engine that is good enough. If you have Improved Fuel Efficiency (IFE),
then the Fuel Mizer will be a good enough engine. If you don't have IFE,
you should try to get the DDL-7 engine or better. For short runs, you
might make do with the LH-6 engine or a transport based on the medium freighter
hull with one fuel tank.

<p>You will probably have to research Construction and Propulsion to get
these items, so be sure to start the research early enough to get it done
before you need to build the ships. Don't start earlier than that, though.
You can temporarily crank up the percentage of resources going to research
to be a large number, to get this research done quickly. Don't forget to
turn it back to 0 when you have what you need.

<p>You might also find that you are using up Germanium so much that you will
run out just when you need to build ships. If this is the case, insert a
batch of (not auto build) mines in the queue for a year.

<p>Once you start moving population off your HW, you will need a place to put
it. The ships you had when you started will have found a few habitable worlds
but you will need to keep looking. You will need to build enough scouts
to find worlds fast enough for you to fill them up. If you want to put about
100,000 colonists on each new world and  your HW is producing 50,000 colonists
in excess of 25% each year, you will need to find a new habitable planet every
two years. If your hab is 1 in 8 and your scouts will take an average of
1.5 years to reach a new planet, then you need 6 scouts working. (The faster
your scouts go, the fewer you will need.) Time the  building of these scouts
so they start working about the time you exceed 25% of capacity on the HW.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Hyper-expander (HE) races should be getting close to
25% of capacity on their home world now. They should
be getting ready to move people off. The hyperexpander
is one race that doesn't need to use fuel mizers or
privateers. The Settler's delight engine can be used
on the mini colony hull to produce three ship types:
the mini-colonizer, the mini-transport and the fuel tanker.
Besides the engine these have a colony pod, a cargo pod
and a fuel tank, respectively.

<p>Non-HE races have a few turns to go yet, but since they
produce about twice as many colonists in excess per turn,
and don't have the nifty engine or hull, they need to do
ore preparation to move. By now you should have figured out
on which turn you will surpass 25% of capacity on your HW,
when you need to build scouts, what tech you need to
research, and when to build  freighters and colony ships.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Most races need to do scouting to find habitable worlds.
There are some exceptions to this. In a universe with maximum
minerals, tri-immune  races such as HEs based on the Silicanoids
don't really need to scout - all planets are equal to them

<p>Warmongers need to scout more than other races. Not only do
they have to find habitable worlds, they also need to find a
target to attack (with their economic settings, they'll never
win by just keeping to themselves). The defensive weaknesses
of Warmongers also make them more reliant on thorough scouting.
Because they have no minelayers and minimal planetary defenses,
Warmongers should always attempt to defeat enemy fleets in
enemy or unoccupied territory. They need to detect those
fleets before they reach the WM's planets.

<p>Races with the No Advanced Scanners LRT will eventually have
to build scouts or some sort of presence to place at all
uninhabited planets near their territory, to detect
planet-hopping invaders.

<br><br><hr><br>

ASK DOCTOR DAVE:<br><br>

<p>(Ask Doctor Dave is an intermittent feature of the turn file cover message.
Doctor Dave gives advice to Stars! players that's worth at least what you
pay for it.)
<br><br>
>Dear Doctor Dave, I have been holding the HW on 25%<br>
>but I have only discovered one habitable planet<bR>
><br>
>Since it seems likely that I will struggle to find habitable<br>
>worlds, I was thinking about building the home world up to say 33% to gain<br>
>more economic production at the expense of some pop growth.  Does this seem<br>
>wise to you?<br><Br>

<p>The fact that you haven't found a habitable world yet may indicate you haven't
been scouting enough, or it may indicate you have been unlucky. How many worlds
have you scouted so far? What portion of worlds do you expect to be habitable
for you? If you only expect to find one inhabitable world in the number you
have scouted, then you should be scouting more. You have to be prepared for a
slightly below average planet draw.

<p>You could let the HW population rise, but if you have a second planet there is
a better choice. You could ship all excess pop to your second planet. This will
minimize the loss of population growth, while still growing your economy.
(This assumes that your second planet has a lower value than your HW.)

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>As contacts with other races increase, you might want to consider
checking that you’re diplomatic settings (F7) and your battle plans (F6)
only lead to conflicts you intend.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>When colonizing planets which are more than 3 years away, it can
make good economic sense to use a colonizer ship based on the
privateer hull, colony pod and two fuel tanks, rather than a colony
pod on a colony ship hull. When you colonize planets one or two years
away a colony ship hull is better. At three years, either will do.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>At this stage it is important to avoid overcrowding your colonists.
You should be trying to keep your home world population down to 25% of
capacity. (Races with high growth rates (18%+) and narrow habs (1:10-) may
have to put up with 33% or even 50% but that is an undesirable compromise.)

<p>If population is higher than 25% of capacity, figure out why, and fix the
problem. If you don't have enough transports, build them. If you don't have
enough minerals to build transports, build more mines. If you don't have
enough habitable planets to which to ship colonists, build more scouts,
or ship more colonists to planets you already have.

<p>If you are going to overcrowd a planet it is best to fill up the small
value planets first. This minimizes lost growth.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Which planets to settle?
<p>As many as possible, as long as you can defend them.
None that will offend your neighbors, unless you want to offend them.
The biggest value ones first, or the ones with the most important
strategic location first.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>A wounded bear is more dangerous than a dead bear.
If you are going to do harm to another race, make
sure you do it enough harm that it cannot hurt you back.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Remember that building ships slows down investment in your economy.
Try to plan you empire's expansion so that it requires a minimum of
shipbuilding. This can be accomplished by making short runs, or
runs to only a few planets at a time.

<br><br><hR><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>A lone race does not fare as well as a race with allies.

<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Now that Public Player Scores are visible, you can get an idea of
how you stand relative to the other races. Any one who asks can
get a private assessment from me of how they got there, and how
they are doing.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>You only need to scout a planet once to tell whether it is habitable, but
you need to keep checking to see if it has become occupied. WM races
especially, because of their vulnerability on defense must constantly scout
to prevent the enemy from gaining a foothold close to the WM's territory.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>There is more than one way to skin a cat. Military operations are not
the only way to achieve an objective.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Before the battleship era, it is usually (but not always) a waste
to add armor to a combat ship's design. Shields and firepower are
more important. Exception to this rule might be made for special-purpose
ships, like minesweepers, which will act alone and encounter repeated
small threats.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>You can frequently save one turn's travel time by adjusting a fleet's
speed when it is part way through a multi-year trip. For instance
you may not have enough fuel to get to a waypoint that is 110ly
away by traveling at warp 8 all the way. However if you travel at warp 7 for
one year you might have enough fuel to travel the rest of the way at warp 8,
thereby saving one year.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>One reason to leave armor off your early combat ship designs, is
that ships with armor are so heavy that they can be too slow to
intercept scouts and colonizers, even when armed with torpedoes.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Wars are usually a net cost to both sides.
<br><br><hr><br>

ASK DOCTOR DAVE:<br><br>

<p>Q. You recommended that I fill up my colonies to 25% and then build a
Starbase to allow further colonization from there.  Building a Starbase
seems to take a very long time.  Is it better to allow the planet to
build up resources first even if this means going over the 25% mark?

<p>A. It depends on the reason that it takes so long to build the starbase.
If it takes so long to build the starbase because the base's cost in resources
is many times what the planet produces each turn, then yes, build up the
resources, and let the pop grow while you do this. If the reason is that the
planet has a shortage of minerals needed to complete the base, you should
ship in the required minerals from your home world or another nearby planet
and build the base as quickly as possible.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Think about upgrading your defenses.

<p>The original Starbase design is vulnerable to torpedo attacks.

<p>Planetary defenses are effective against bombs, invasions and
packets.

<p>Minefields usually make an attack move slower, giving you more time
to react.

<p>Planetary scanners and scouts at advance locations give you an early
warning of any approaching threat.

<p>By the time you are under attack, it is too late to build these things.
You must build defensive measures before you need them.
<br><br><hr><br>

ASK DOCTOR DAVE:<br><br>

<p>Q. What would you view as an appropriate mix of torps and beam weapons
to mount on a base, and also shields or armor or both?  Computers?

<p>The appropriate mix of torpedoes, missiles beams and sappers varies as
technology advances. When beams are only at range 1 or 2, it is important
to have some torpedoes to be able to reach enemy ships armed with
torpedoes. If the enemy only has range one beams, you might want to include
some blackjacks on your base. When you have range three beams and sappers,
you might be able to leave torpedoes off entirely, until your enemy gets
missiles. Once your enemy starts attacking with missiles, you need them
too. When his jamming gets high, switch to torpedoes. However, by that
stage in a game, a base isn't really able to defend itself. It needs a
fleet to help.

<p>Whenever you have torpedoes or missiles, you need enough computing to win
the initiative and counter any jamming. Any other slots can be used for
jamming. For beam-only bases, use capacitors.

<p>I frequently balance the shield strength with the armor strength. Often this
means three stacks of shields and one of armor. This is most useful when
facing missile-armed ships, whose damage doubles when shields are down, or
when you expect to be subject to repeated attacks which you can hold off,
(the shields replenish after every year, armor takes longer to repair). Of
course if you can more then double your defensive strength by using armor
instead of shields, it can be a better choice.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Try to fill up your small worlds and your HW before filling
up any other larger worlds.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Try to avoid fighting battles you cannot win.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Think about who should be your friends and enemies.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Sometimes lots of little cheap ships can be more effective
than a few big, expensive ones. Other times the opposite is
true. Look at the costs and the benefits.
<br><br><hr><br>

ASK DOCTOR DAVE:<br><br>

<p>Q. If I build chaff, do they have to be at least as fast as the ships
they protect to be effective?

<p>A. Their battle speed needs to be fast enough that the ships they are
protecting do not enter the enemy's range before the chaff, but slow
enough that they do not enter the enemy's range before the ships
they are protecting.

<p>Chaff is usually only effective against torps and missiles, BTW.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Combat ships with beams are generally stronger at this stage
than same tech missiles.
<br><br><hr><br>

ASK DOCTOR DAVE:<br><br>

<p>Q. What orders do I give a fleet intercepting the mystery trader?

<p>It doesn't need a waypoint task where it meets the trader. It just
has to get to the same spot as the trader, with the trader specified
as the waypoint.

<p>Remember that all ship sin the fleet will be absorbed unless the fleet
is carrying less than 5,000ky of minerals as cargo.
<br><br><hr><br>


TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Napoleon said "Force equals mass times velocity". One thing to learn
from this is it is important to concentrate ones forces.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>It is better to run and live than stand and die.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>A major war can easily last for the rest of the game.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>When designing warships, keep the following tips in mind:

<p>Ships with range 3 beams should try for battle speed of 2 1/4 or
1 1/2. This covers the entire board in 2 or 3 turns, respectively.
Ships with range 2 beams should try for battle speed of 2 or 1 1/2.
This covers the entire board in 3 or 4 turns, respectively.

<p>Attack shielded frigates with torps.

<p>Attack large shield stacks with sappers.

<p>Use shields against an enemy who doesn't have sappers.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>One disadvantage of the attack is that you have to build your attack
fleet before you get to your target. If the defender can discover
the composition of your fleet, he might be able to build counter
designs for defense.
<br><br><hr><br>

TIP OF THE DAY:<br><br>

<p>Try to avoid fighting a battle unless you know you will win.
