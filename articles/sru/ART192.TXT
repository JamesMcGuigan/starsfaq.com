     This text file will assist you in editing various items in the STARS!
game. Using this file, knowledge of hex/dec numbers, and a good hex editing
program ( We recommend Ultraedit32 for Win95 ) you wil be able to edit ship
& starbase hulls, tech requirements, mineral requirements, terraforming %'s,
stargate limits, nearly everything.. Things you will not be able to do is
change PRT/LRT requirements or MT Toys to available.. You can change the
tech levels and mineral requirements of MT Toy Plans you are given and
mod the Mini-Morph hull thou..
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     First off, let us touch on the very basics of hex editng a game to your
liking. 


1) First off, never ever hex edit your STARS!.EXE file, always edit a
   copy of the .EXE calling it, for our example, TUNSTAR.EXE .. This gives you
   insurance if you screw up, as well as leaving a virgin copy of the game for
   normal playing. After editing a file, you would copy TUNSTAR.EXE back
   to your Stars! directory and run TUNSTAR.EXE instead of Stars!.exe
   ( as player OR as host, all players MUST run the same edited copy! )

2) You should know how to convert between hex and decimal numbers
   If you use Windows95, you can simply use the calculator that comes
   with windows ( look in the Accessories Group ), and once you run
   it, simple toggle it ( pulling down VIEW ) and select Scientific.
   You can simple punch in the numbers and convert between hex and dec
   by selecting the mode ( Hex, Dec, Oct and Bin are the options there )


3) Single byte hex numbers is inforamtion stored in 1 byte representing
   a decimal number. In Stars! for example, Tech level requirements are
   stored this way. A hex number of 0F for example would convert to 16
   in decimal, thus changing that byte from a 0F to a 05 would lower that
   tech requirement from 16 to 5

4) Double byte ( 2 byte ) hex numbers store information across 2 bytes. In
   STARS! this is done in 3 ways Shown below

16 based        First byte = 1's      2nd byte = 16's
128 based       First byte = 1's      2nd byte = 128's
256 based       First byte = 1's      2nd byte = 256's

    OK, so what does that mean. That means if we have the following 2 bytes
    and for our example, the thing you are editing is 256 based

                             FE 01

    The first thing you would want to do is convert the hex numbers into
    decimal so you can work with it. For this example it would end up being

                            254  1 
 
    OF we know that the 254 represents 1's and the 1 represents 256's so
    knowing that we have

                           254 * 1's = 254
                           1 * 256's = 256

    The total of those 2 numbers is 510, so the thing we are editing ( lets
    further say its the ironium requirement of a ship hull for better
    understanding in this example ) requires 510 pieces of ironium. Now,
    lets say, you wish to drop that to 300 ironium, what would the 2 byte
    hex number be?? Heres how you figure it

                            300 / 256 = 1
                   with 44 remaining ( 300-256 = 44 )

   So now we know there is 1 of the 256's and 44 of the 1's, so now we have

                                 44  1

   We now have to convert those decimal numbers into hex to replace in the
   file we are editing, the result of this would be

                                 2C  01

   Replace the 2 bytes, and blam!, you only need 300 instead of 510 pieces
   of ironium to build that hull now!

    I hope you will understand this principle and how it is used with 128's
and 16's, it should be fairly clear and simple we hope. :)

   Now for the guts you have been waiting for, the stars! database structures
themselves. All starting locations are for Stars! 2.6b, it will vary from
version to version, but really it isnt important where is starts in your
version, cause once it starts, it is all the same after that

Note 1: There are 16 possible Slots that are used by Stars! to create hulls.
        Of course, not all of them need to be used ( even the Nubian doesnt
        use them all ). BUT, the first slot MUST always be a engine ( in
        ships only ), and all other slots used must be in order, no
        skipping slots !!. Use 1, then 2, then 3, and so on

    OK, as you see, each slot is made up of 4 bytes of information. The first
3 bytes controls what type of slot it is ( General purpose, Bomb, Orbital,
so so forth ). The 4 byte is the max amount ( or required in the case of
engines ) the slot can hold. This 4th byte is a single byte hex number, and
you would edit it just like you would the tech levels of an item. The
first 3 bytes control what a slot is. These 3 bytes work together to and make
a bit based control of what a slot is..

Whats a Bit ??

who cares, here's some quick charts so you can just make the slots what you
want them to be. Note, often strange combo's of types will say COMBO in the
slot in the ship design hull. Dont worry about it, and yes, while you can
put a orbital slot on the ship, you still cant put a stargate on a ship :)

OK, nice charts you say, but how do I use them ?? Simple, Lets say for example
you wanted a BOMB/MINING ROBOT/MINE LAYING slot on your hull. First you would
goto byte#1 chart and see if it has anything you need, and yes, it does. We
need BOMB and MINING ROBOT from it. Each of those things has a value. In
this case BOMB has a value of 64 and MINING ROBOT has a value of 128. Take
64 and add 128 to it. The result is 192. So, we need a value of 192 in the
1st byte in order to get bombs and the mining robots. We need to get the
mine laying ability now. Well, the 1st byte chart doesnt have Mines on it,
but the 2nd byte chart does. And according to the chart, it has a value of 1.
So, since we need nothing else, for our 2nd byte we need a value of 1 put
in in order to be able to put Mine laying ability.  There is nothing we
need from the 3rd byte chart, so the value we need for byte 3 is zero ( 0 )

OK, so we have our values for each byte. they are

                            192   1    0

Now, all we need is the 4th byte value which will be how many or the max.
number this slot we are making is going to have. For our example, lets say
we want 5 as the max number of stuff in this slot. We now have all 4 bytes
worth of values to make our ship slot now. They are, in order

                              192   1   0   5

           You would convert these decimal numbers into Hex

                               C0 01 00 05

And you would place these into the ship slot as the 4 bytes it needs, and blam
you have a ship slot that can hold up to 5 bombs, or 5 miners, or 5 mines !

======------======---====

*** Note 2:
    Hull Inititive settings in Stars! is wierd at best. Normally, when
we look at a hex number, lets say 1A, we would take 1A and convert it to
decimal and see our inititive right there. But NO, stars! takes this hex
number and splits it in 2 pieces like this


1C   -----+----->  1
          |----->  A

Stars! treats each number/letter alone now, placeing them apart like this

                              1     A


We convert the numbers to decimal getting

                              1     10

In stars! ship and starbase INIT., the first number is 16's and the 2nd
number is the 1's, so we get

                              1 * 16's  = 16
                             10 *  1's  = 10

Adding them together, our ship has a INIT of 26 in our example.

Now lets say we want it to be 28 instead of 26, we would then

                              28 / 16 = 1
                            With 12 remaining

Which leaves us with the values ( remember, this ship init stuff is backwards
from all other things in the database! )

                                  1  12

Which we convert to hex

                                  1   C

We put the 2 halfs back together

                                    1C

And put this in the byte for Ship/Starbase INIT.

======-======-======-=====-

*** Note 3

     Ship slot location uses each half of the hex number as x and y
so putting  14 hex in a ship slot XY byte would put that slot in square
1,4

This format is also used to draw those Cargo hold and Space dock areas
that have the gray lines thru them. If you put 44 hex in byte 126 ( bottom
right ) and 11 hex in byte 127 ( top left ), Stars! make and fill a box
from 1,1 to 4,4 and fill it with gray lines, and place the ships KT or
the starbases dock space centered within it

Allowed values are 0 - 8

   53-54    |   2   | 256's| Range In Light Years ( See Note )

### Note: There are 2 types of  Planet based Scanners. The normal ones
          and the SX series which can also determine a planets stats
          ( normally 1/2 the distance of the total scan range )
          The way STARS! determines if a planet scanner is capable of
          being a SX series is kinda tricky but once you understand
          it is actually very easy....

          For example sake, lets say we have a scanner we wish to change
          to normal 300 light years range. we know that scanner range is
          a 2 byte 256's number, so for 300 we would find that:

                              300 / 256 = 1
                            With 44 remaining

           This gives us the 1's and 256's in 300 in decimal

                                 44  1

                Which we convert to hex ending up with

                                 2C 01

              Which we promptly place into bytes 53 and 54

OK, now we want to make a SX 300 light year scanner that can see a planets
stats ( at 150 light years, it will always be 1/2 the total ), we need to
do a bit more math. If stars! sees any number over 32768 light years (wow!)
as the scanner range, it takes that number and subtracts it from 65536
and turns it into a SX series scanner.

OK, you with us so far. OK, now to make the scanner we wish, we need to
figure out what 65536 - 300 is !

                          65536 - 300 = 65236

     Ok, so now we know that we need to put in as a scanner range the
     result 65236, and stars! will make a 300sx scanner instead of a
     normal 300 light year scanner, so we figure out

                           65236 / 256 = 254
                          with 212 remaining

              Give us the bytes we need in decimal being

                              212  254

                Which we convert to hex ending up with

                                D4 FE

        Which we place into bytes 53 and 54, and blam, there it is :)

#### NOTE : Terraforming items ADD UP as you learn them, so dont go too
            crazy ( +-3 + +-5 + +-10  = +-18 terraforming total ). If
            you go nuts, the map will be nearly impossible to see clearly
            when you have it in planet worth% mode.
