<p>Well, might save you a bit in the less active areas.  Not much work-load reduction really, though. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Quite right. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Maybe it is less than clear to everyone what I mean by "staying unpredictable" with minelayer movements as SD.  It isn't just a question of enemies intercepting minelayers - because the minelayers aren't just laying patterns of mines. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Non-SD minelayers can't lay in a turn they move, and normally you want them laying.  Occasionally they move to a new field-laying location.  But they are basically passive things (some exceptions for heavily cloaked ones, since they typically won't be seen the turn they move to a new field location - can make them almost as useful as SD mines sometimes). <br><br>

</p>

<p>I have seen SD players, relatively new at it, who used their mines more or less in that same fashion as other races; they just had more laying ability, more types of mines, and set fields off from time to time too.  Marginally better than other race's mines - fine.  But not the best way to use the SD's awesome combo of lay-on-arrival, super cheap and efficient laying power, and mines that go boom. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Because they lay on moving, you can use your mini-minelayers as a intergral part of your skirmishing force.  Your layers should be at least as active as his sweeping DDs and cruisers.  "Active" - abstract. <br><br>

</p>

<p>What do I mean? <br><br>

</p>

<p>I mean the baited trap - the unescorted minelayer that leads interceptors to a bigger group of your own escorts.  I mean the dodge - moving to 82 or 101 LY from a likely interceptor while making progress towards a tactical objective for the following year.  I mean the "drag" - the pursuer led through a speed bump field (to stop him) in the middle of a standard field set to go off.  I mean "shields on" - an entire quadrant explodes that year and every mine lost to the detonations is replayed.  I mean "seige" - overlapping fields of every type all around an enemy fleet, a coordinated move by most minelayers near it.  I mean the "jump" - where every single minelayer leaves the existing fields to extend them 81 LY further in the direction of the enemy, each starting a new field that year.  I mean the "thrower" - a well defended planet and/or fleet with dozens of minelayers stationed there, half of which jump out to lay while the other half return to it for cover - every year to relay everything swept. <br><br>

</p>

<p>The list is endless.  Full use of lay-on-arrival and small cheap 2-pod layers means the layers must mate their actions with sweepers, attack fleets, interceptors.  Must react to the enemies sweepers, fleets, tactics.  Every single square LY could have a minelayer at it at the end of next turn along an entire front, several hundred LYs deep.  He should never know where that particular layer is going; he should never know where the mines will be; he should never be able to assure that any area stays swept, or that any particular group of interceptors won't be ambushed, etc. <br><br>

</p>

<p>Done right, it is very powerful.  But it is also very time-consuming. <br><br>
