<p><u>Alternators Nickname</u> - for Alternate Reality races. <br><br>

<p><u>Capital Ship</u> - A warship with a rating of more than 2000. <br><br>

<p><u>Colonizer</u> - Any ship equiped with the colonisation module and thus able to colonize a planet. <br><br>

<p><u>Colonist Bomb</u> - Common term for invading someone's planet with a obviously superior force. <br><br>

<p><u>Detonating Minefield</u> - A Minefield set to remotely explode by it's SD owner. <br><br>

<p><u>Gate Scans</u> - Common term for scans of gate-carrying planets performed by IT gates. <br><br>

<p><u>Hybrid</u> - A race combining features of Hyper Growth and Hyper Producer races (see below) <br><br>

<p><u>Hyper Growth (HG)</u> - A race with a high growh rate and good colinist resource efficience (res. per col., e.g. : 1/1000) <br><br>

<p><u>Hyper Producer (HP)</u> -  A race with a high factory efficiency (e.g. 15/7/25), a low colonist resource efficiency (e.g. : 1/2500) and most of the time lesser mining abbilities. <br><br>

<p><u>Instaforming</u> - The CA's ability to instantly terraform a planet he colonizes.  <br><br>

<p><u>Light year</u> - The Distance light Travels in 1 year. This is approx. 9 000 000 000 000 km ( 9 * 1012 km )  <br><br>

<p><u>Magnitude</u> - The brightness of a solar object. Each order of magnitude is exactly 2.512 times brighter than the previous one. e.g. : 2m is 3m * 2.512.   <br><br>

<p><u>Mass accelerator</u> - A device used to fling/catch Mineral Packets at various warp speeds. <br><br>

<p><u>Mass Driver</u> - see : Mass accelerator <br><br>

<p><u>Mining robots</u> - Robots you drop on an uninhabitted planet to mine it.   <br><br>

<p><u>Mico-Management</u> - Having to take care of lots of details each turn   <br><br>

<p><u>Remote Terraformers</u> - Ships equiped with Orbital Adjustors. <br><br>

<p><u>Resources</u> - Your production capacity. Consider it your money.   <br><br>

<p><u>Speed Trap</u> - A mine which, when hit, will stop your fleet in space. Also refered to as : Speed Bumb. <br><br>

<p><u>Stargate</u> - A device with wich you can send ships from planet to planet in one year, considering both planets are equiped with a stargate and the Stargates limitations aren't exceeded. <br><br>

<p><u>Warp speed</u> - The speed at wich objects move. This is : Warp * Warp ly/y. e.g. : Warp 5 = 5*5 = 25ly/year <br><br>
