<h3>Ultimate Race<br>
by: John Doe</h3>

<p>I remember someone once asked about what the best race against the AI's was. Well, here's what I think is *the* best. I beat 3 Expert AI in less than 70 years. <br><br>

</p>

<h4>Hyper Expansion PRT <br><br>

</h4>

<p>Improved Starbases, to protect your border colonies. Basic Remote Mining, because you don't need to remote mine, you'll see later. <br><br>

Habitable Range:<br>
Immune to all!<bR><br>
6% growth rate, for it if doubled to 12%, and you don't need to high a growth rate for one important reason: Everything is 100% for your colonists! <br><br>

Production:<br>
One resource generated for every 900 colonists.<br>
10 factories make 12 resources per year.<br>
Factories require 8 resources to build.<br>
10,000 colonists operate up to 12 factories.<br>
Factories cost one less of each mineral.<br>
10 mines make 11 kt of each mineral.<br>
Mines are 4 resources to build.<br>
10,000 colonists operate 13 mines.<br>
The strategy with this race is to expand like crazy at first, building (at leat) three mini-colonizers each turn and sending them to colonize. In the mid game, you should already have about 70+ planets (mid game is about year 2440). You then should already have the Meta-Morph hull, and build them to protect you colonies, and build ultra-stations at your border colonies to protect them. Soon, you should be declared a winner. <br><br>
