<h3>Advanced IT Design and Play, v2.0?<br>
By Dieter Wallisch</h3>
<p>

<P><I>Note: This is the latest version of my article, written end of february
1998. I’ve made some significant changes in</I>
<BR><I>race-design as well as some in gameplay, which I want to let you
know. By the way, the testbed results changed,</I>
<BR><I>hmmm, a little bit. Some passages in this document are completely
new (I did them in italics), some have not</I>
<BR><I>been changed, so please re-read carefully. Maybe, you’ll find something
helpful.</I>

<P>I’ve finally decided to give away my favourite IT race-design combined
with a few tips playing it, as well as
<BR>some testbed results, because – due to lack of time - I’m not able
to participate in multiplayer games as much as I
<BR>want to. Please excuse my poor English, but I didn’t want to write
this in German, in order to reach as many
<BR>Stars!-freaks as possible.

<P><B>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Race name and leftover points</B>

<P>Of course, this race does have a unique name, but I won’t reveal it,
because I’dont want other players in future
<BR>multiplayer games to know about my race data (so you see – this REALLY
is my favourite race design). Be
<BR>creative!
<BR>If I have leftover points I always go for surface minerals, because
you simply can’t have enough at the start. If
<BR>you have a better argument for another choice, please let me know.

<P><B>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT – pros and cons</B>

<P>The IT‘s are a very strong (maybe the strongest one, playing in a large
or better universe with normal or sparse
<BR>density) and versatile race, allowing a quick start (grabbing early
territory over hundreds of ly) as well as strong
<BR>offensive and defensive play (including unique and interesting diplomatic
abilities).

<P>You start with two planets, five ships and tech 0-0-5-5-0-0 at least.
You may build (cheaper) stargates with
<BR>unlimited capacities, which also act as longrange (LR) scanners. And
most importantly you are the only race in
<BR>the game, able to gate minerals and colonists as well (exceeding the
safety limits of stargates A LOT).

<P>IT’s have only one disadvantage, which is insignificant in my opinion:
their reduced ability to fling mineral
<BR>packets. But those would only cost you lots of resources to produce
and would never reach their destination in
<BR>one turn. There are disadvantages in flinging packets as well: used
as scanners (by a PP) or as weapons, they cost
<BR>you lots of minerals and will reveal your homeworlds position to other
players. Besides, they could be
<BR>intercepted by others (especially by a SS-race), even at highest speed,
using an utility like e.g. the
<BR>Stars!calculator by Mathias Dellaert.
<BR>If there is any significant advantage in flinging packets, the IT certainly
makes even, gating minerals (and
<BR>colonists!!) and using the 100/any stargate as the ultimate LR scanner.

<P>Let me point out a very important exclusive component, that is often
overlooked in discussions concerning the
<BR>IT: the anti-matter generator (200 mg fueltank + 50 mg xtra fuel/yr.;
available at weapons tech 12 and bio tech
<BR>7). Of course, this item will cost you one electrical or general slot,
but, in combination with being IT, it certainly
<BR>gives you the ability to renounce IFE and will speed up all your ship
designs – especially those with the great
<BR>interspace 10 engine, which you get at prop tech 11 (which I consider
quite early in the game), if you choose
<BR>NRSE (just a shame you can’t put this generator into an orbital fort
– would be a great cheap gas station).

<P><B>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT and LRT’s</B>

<P>I won’t discuss all the LRT’s in detail, but I will tell you, which
ones I‘ve chosen for my race and which ones
<BR>would make another great choice, if you prefer a different style of
play. You will also find some gameplay tips in
<BR>this section.

<P>IFE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably my hardest decision, not to take
this one for my race. The fuel-mizer really is a great engine,
<BR>especially at warp 9. If&nbsp; put on a frigate with 3 fuelpods only,
all your ships in the fleet may travel at high
<BR>warpspeeds for quite a while; not to mention warp 4 for free. But beeing
an IT, this as well as the other IFE-
<BR>advantages is less important: using your two starting planets and stargates,
you may even spread into a larger
<BR>part of the universe, using a normal engine. Besides – you won’t have
the fuel-mizer in your starting ships,
<BR>because as an IT with prop tech 5 you always get the daddy long legs
7. Considering the anti-matter generator,
<BR>the fuel reduction won‘t pay off as well. And as I always do choose
NRSE, I would loose the scoop engines
<BR>anyway. So I decided to keep the points.

<P>TT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great, but costs a lot of points, which I
cannot afford. I’d rather go for a better HAB range to find more
<BR>suitable planets. Maybe you will be able to ally with a CA, giving
him access to your stargate-network and/or
<BR>tech xfer and/or intersettling – in return you could receive some orbital
adjuster ships for cheaper terraforming.

<P><I>(Note: I’ve recently tested a variant of this race, including TT.
But in order to get the points, you have to choose</I>
<BR><I>a lower HAB-range, of course: lets say around 1 in 6, close to 1
in 7. And you’ll also have to sacrifice IS, what</I>
<BR><I>will influence speed as well as defence. Making worse your economy,
I don’t consider beeing an option. I was</I>
<BR><I>not impressed by the results: besides making terraforming cheaper,
the real advantage (terraforming up to 30%)</I>
<BR><I>occurs to late in the game. I could neither see my number of inhabitable
planets increase, nor did I have more</I>
<BR><I>production centers. Choosing bio tech normal or 50% cheaper may
change the result, but where should I get the</I>
<BR><I>points from?).</I>

<P>ARM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never, as I need OBRM to get the important
xtra 10% of&nbsp; population, in order to compete with JOAT
<BR>and CA races in possible maximum planetary output as well as with HE’s
concerning fast growth.

<P>IS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good choice, as I will build many orbital forts
and space docks with stargates, which will now cost
<BR>less resources. Cloaking is always fine and an ultra station may give
an xtra round needed to gate in my
<BR>defensive units, if attacked. Besides, as an IT I’ll be able to build
those space docks (with only a stargate) right
<BR>from the start of the game, giving me the ability to build and send
out ships from my second planet as soon as
<BR>possible. As I can also refuel there, this is another reason why I
don’t have to choose IFE.

<P>GR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never, disadvantages are to hard; maybe good
for an SS race, if you try to hide and win without
<BR>diplomacy and tech xfer (I don‘t think that‘s possible) because of
the xtra free research points. But I don‘t want
<BR>to spend points on all techs all the time (think of bio tech later
in the game or of specializing in two areas for tech
<BR>xfer); I also prefer to gain a level faster, if I desperatly need to.

<P>UR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I’d rather carefully choose the point,
when to design a new vessel. Also, I like the idea of confusing
<BR>other players, by showing them (only) my obsolete ship designs, not
revealing my true strength. Old ships may
<BR>also be useful in diplomatic terms (transfer fleet) or as defense units
in less important zones; maybe even for a
<BR>diversion attack, in order to decoy the defensive units from the real
target. If nothing else, use them as a freighter
<BR>escort (this sort of protection is often overlooked anyway – just think
of the cloaking abilities&nbsp; of SS races!) <I>or</I>
<BR><I>sacrifice them in order to learn about the ship designs of your
enemies.</I>

<P>MA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waste of points as my race builds cheap mines
and gates minerals. Even with MA, transferring
<BR>resources is too expensive.

<P>NRSE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I’m a fan of the interspace 10 engine
(available rather early in the game, see above) and don’t like
<BR>the ramscoops anyway (less movement in battle, weaker in minefields)
I took this LRT. OK, some scoops are
<BR>fine, but they arrive too late in the game and as an IT I have the
anti-matter generator anyway (besides using my
<BR>stargates!!). And I need the points.

<P>CE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I> Is considered a reasonable choice especially
for ITs by some authors</I>, but I say: Never. No explosive
<BR>start possible, makes you slower throughout the whole game and an easy
target even for players with lower prop
<BR>tech.

<P>OBMR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can afford cheap mines, this is
a good choice thinking of growth and max planet output (see
<BR>above under ARM). Considering the points, I took it.

<P>NAS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of points I went for, though I admit
that advanced planetary scanners have both a fine defensive
<BR>and offensive potential. Try to get scouts with penetrating scanners
from your allies (from a SS race?) or visit
<BR>mystery traders when you have the minerals in order to get the langston
shell (megapoly shell or multi contained
<BR>munition have even better penetrating scanners,but may be available
too late in the game because of tech
<BR>requirements). Pro: your scanners have double range! I like to use
scouts with e.g. the dna (or possum) scanner
<BR>instead of building planetary ones: saves both germanium and resources
and you see any (uncloaked) ship-
<BR>movements within 250-300 ly. If you take NAS, it won’t be necessary
to spend resources on elec-tech research,
<BR>so you can save resources for other tech research (remeber – I said
I don’t like GR – get the point?). On the other
<BR>hand – later in the game you may need cloaking, jammers, advanced computers,
but until then...

<P>LSP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never, because I want an explosive start
(though I don’t see this as a pure quickstart race – it has high –
<BR>if not hyperproduction qualities as well). Please consider that starting
an IT is always slower, because the starting
<BR>population is divided for two planets and the second one may have a
poor percentage – so even with a high
<BR>growth rate the disadvantage is too big for the points.

<P>BET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather not, because miniaturisation occurs
too late and what is new tech good for, if you can’t use it
<BR>because of its costs <I>(I’ve to admit, that I’m not absolutely sure
about this in terms of very long games. Maybe</I>
<BR><I>worth a try, if you can afford to start slower).</I>

<P>RS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be fine if I could afford ener tech
cheap, because my ships would be lighter (faster + range + less
<BR>fuel). But remember the anti-matter generator as well as our need to
research const tech anyway for our special
<BR>unlimited stargates – so we will have good armor (also very fine: organic
armor at bio tech 7) and enough fuel
<BR>for warships with it.

<P><B>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growth rate and HAB range</B>

<P>As I told you, I’m going for a good start and I want to gate as many
colonists as possible to my new worlds. So
<BR>I’m taking the highest GR I can afford – also, to make that OBRM-choice
worth while! I’d love to take 20%, but
<BR>the last one costs xtra points, so I settle for 19%.

<P>Though this race travels very fast, it‘s not too good in scanning (NAS).
So you can’t afford to set your HAB
<BR>range too low. Another point is, that with an higher HAB range, your
max planet output can be a bit lower while
<BR>giving you the same resources in the end (because of more possible
production centers, wider use for
<BR>terraforming).

<P><I>Let‘s take a look at the following (updated!) ranges:</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Gravity:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0,58 to 5,12</I>
<BR><I>Temperature:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -72 to 152</I>
<BR><I>Radiation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
12 to 68</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Yes, I changed those quite a bit. First, there is no reason to move
a bar all the way to the edge (except for the</I>
<BR><I>points, but this will cost you inhabitable planets), considering
that you waste half of your terraforming abilities.</I>
<BR><I>Second, those settings are still quite centered, allowing you to
also inhibit worlds with either very high or very</I>
<BR><I>low values, using your terraforming abilities. I hope you get the
point.</I>

<P><I>&nbsp;In some games, it seemed to me that there were rather more
planets, having the gravity and temperature values</I>
<BR><I>on opposit edges, than planets with those two on the same edge.
Unfortunately, I don’t have any statistics about</I>
<BR><I>that and therefore I didn’t change anything. If you do, please let
me know!</I>

<P>Race wizard tells us, that the result is 1 in 4, but it is close to
1 in 5. Doesn’t sound too good to you? Well, we
<BR>will have a testbed anyway, so lets wait and see.

<P>I’d like to say a bit about my choice in radiation: the Stars! user
guide says, that the radiation value of a planet is
<BR>chosen completely at random, while the other two values tend to be
more often around the center. So you may
<BR>choose a value that‘s near the edge, without having disadvantages (and
get points).
<BR>Try to move the radiation-bar to the other edge of the scale! Now what,
you will get more points if you choose a
<BR>higher radiation level?? Yes, that‘s right. And therefore I took the
lower one. But stop it, are we wasting points
<BR>here??

<P>Definitely not. More points for a higher level makes it more likely,
that other players will choose so (especially if
<BR>they have to get points from a higher rad range and tend to transport
colonists with the radiating ramscoop
<BR>engine). But as I don’t want to fight for all of my planets later in
the game, and as I took NRSE I will go for the
<BR>opposit choice. This may also give me a higher chance of a peace treaty,
that rather includes an intersettling
<BR>program than fixed borders (I will be able to take all the low rad
worlds, that the others don’t want). With my
<BR>stargate technology, such a program could be the opportunity to go
far beyond my neighbours borders.

<P><B>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economy</B>

<P>I’m not absolutely sure about this in terms of hyperproduction, but
I tend to leave the resources per colonists
<BR>(RPC) rate at 1000 (note: an older version of this race design had
a RPC of 2300, allowing a max of 25 factories
<BR>and an efficency of 15 resources/factories. In combination with OBRM
that resulted in a max planetary output of
<BR>4603 resources – great. But there were cons: I had to go for a smaller
HAB range, and the start was not as
<BR>explosive; besides it takes longer to establish new colonies, especially
to build an orbital fort with a stargate, in
<BR>order to gate in colonists, minerals and ships. A year or two can be
very important in an offensive conflict
<BR>situation – will my other offensive units, which are gateable whatever
their size is, arrive faster than his
<BR>defensive ones? Testbed results did the rest, so I changed the RPC
to 1000! Take the old design as a variant, if
<BR>you want to – but before playing it, compare both in a testbed).

<P><I>My factories are now at 12_7_22 (produce_require_operateable), with
OBRM resulting in a max planetary</I>
<BR><I>output of 4004 resources/year, which is significantly better than
the 3740 resources in the former version of this</I>
<BR><I>document. Great, considering my HAB range is 1 in 4. I also reduced
the costs of the factories, because I found</I>
<BR><I>it quite difficult to get anywhere near to 25k in 2450 with the
old settings (certainly, the IT’s aren‘t a race with</I>
<BR><I>significant advantages in economy like HE, CA or JOAT – please refer
to other articles on that particular topic).</I>

<P><I>I always check costs less G! Costs cheap points if you think about
it (maxed out 100% world would be 1100000</I>
<BR><I>colonists = 2420 max factories = 7260 units G. Or would you rather
spend 9680 units G? The difference is the</I>
<BR><I>equivalent of 34 (!) planetary scanners. Look at my mine settings,
consider&nbsp; OBRM and think about it!).</I>

<P><I>Mines are now set to 10_3_11 (slightly cheaper and one more operateable);
they have to be cheap in the early</I>
<BR><I>game. You should not have problems with this settings in combination
with OBRM, as minerals are gateable for</I>
<BR><I>the IT (see testbed results). If you do (poor homeworld ? poor management
?) use diplomacy to get some</I>
<BR><I>advanced miners from an ally (remember – you can gate them in any
size – for yourself or for him) or pray for</I>
<BR><I>the alien mining robot (very strong item!!) if you sacrifice your
last 5000 kt of minerals to the mystery trader.</I>

<P><B>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research</B>

<P><I>In order to survive early conflicts, I’d like to choose weap tech
standard; in order to get the all-important</I>
<BR><I>any/300 stargate and big ship hulls early enough, I would also like
to select const tech standard as I did in the</I>
<BR><I>older version of my race. But I had to free some points for economy
and, as you will see in the testbed results,</I>
<BR><I>research is the best way to do that</I> (remember that your exclusive
ability to gate huge warships and bombers
<BR>over 1000ly and more in a few turns will help you to get any tech from
your allies, if you let them use your gate
<BR>network – e.g. weap tech from a WM?).<I> This race might suffer without
tech trade in a very long game though.</I>

<P>I‘ve set all techs to +75% now and did NOT check the start at three
box (don’t worry; in most games you won’t
<BR>need all the weapons tech etc early on – experienced players avoid
early conflicts and rather ally with their
<BR>neighbours. As the years pass, you will produce enough resources to
have all the goodies you need – and if you
<BR>get some tech in xchange from your neighbours: even better!).

<P><B>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result</B>

<P>If you followed my suggestions step-by-step, you should now have 2 points
leftover. In case my English is too
<BR>poor or my decision to give some playing and diplomacy tips during
race creation has confused you a little bit,
<BR>here is a summary of my favourite race:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>NAME:&nbsp;&nbsp; ??? (see above)</I>
<BR><I>LEFTOVER POINTS: surface minerals</I>
<BR><I>PRT:&nbsp;&nbsp; IT</I>
<BR><I>LRT’s:&nbsp;&nbsp; IS, NRSE, OBRM, NAS</I>
<BR><I>GROWTH:&nbsp; 19%</I>
<BR><I>HAB-RANGE:&nbsp; 1 of 4 (0,58_5,12 / -72_152 / 12_68)</I>
<BR><I>RPC:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000</I>
<BR><I>FACTORIES:&nbsp; 12_7_22 (max planet output 4004); less G checked</I>
<BR><I>MINES:&nbsp;&nbsp; 10_3_11</I>
<BR><I>RESEARCH:&nbsp; all at +75%; start at 3 NOT checked</I>
<BR><I>(2 points leftover)</I>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testbed results</B>

<P>In order to be able to compare a certain race with another (even of
another PRT), let them compete in a testbed.
<BR>Important: don’t play them against each other (or you won’t see which
is the better starter or better in
<BR>longterms), but compare the results you get when you play a single
race all alone in the universe. This is also a
<BR>fine practice before you are using a race, which was created by another
person, in a multiplayer game.

<P><I>I decided to give you testbed results with settings to allow you
a comparison with other listings on various</I>
<BR><I>websites.</I>

<P>My settings in the testbed were:

<P>DIFFICULTY:&nbsp; harder (don’t know if this is of any influence to
the score, just in case)
<BR>SIZE:&nbsp;&nbsp; small
<BR>DENSITY:&nbsp; normal
<BR>POSITIONS:&nbsp; farther (should not be of any influence, as your race
is all alone)
<BR>SLOWER TECH ADV: checked
<BR>GALAXY CLUMPING: checked

<P>!!! Important note: when you check the results, please consider that
they are NOT from an Acc Bbs game. This
<BR>game was started normally. Also, through the lack of competition, I
may have made some bad decisions during
<BR>play. Of course, as there are no enemies in such a game, there is no
need of building warships, minelayers or
<BR>anything. So in a real game, you would have to spend xtra resources
and minerals, but therefore there is possibly
<BR>trade, tech xchange, tech gained in battle etc. Remember, this test
is only a test of growth, HAB, expansion and –
<BR>of course - economy.

<P>At the beginning, I set the tech research to 0% and bio tech; later
on, I changed the subject, but not the rate. Of
<BR>course I got lots of research points, when my production-queues were
empty, and because of some artifacts.

<P><I>HOMEWORLD: 100% (what else); I and B conc was 30 (the minimum possible);
G was around 100</I>
<BR><I>(excellent).</I>
<BR><I>PLANET 2: 81% (excellent); I conc 17, B conc around 100 (very good);
but G conc only 23</I>
<BR><I>(rather bad).</I>

<P><I>I suffered a bit from the low G on the second at the start (not as
fast as I hoped), as I</I>
<BR><I>had to use the G from my HW for Planet2 as well as for all the early
colonized worlds.</I>
<BR><I>Therefore, the history graph on resources is too flat between yr
20 and yr 25, but then</I>
<BR><I>heads skywards. Maybe I should play another 10 or 20 turns to see
the results.</I>

<P>RESULTS:

<P><B>Please take a close look at the results, they have changed significantly!</B>

<P><I>YEAR 10:&nbsp; 417 resources (IT usually starts slow, as population
is divided on 2 planets)</I>
<BR><I>YEAR 20:&nbsp; 1824 resources (remember: this is NOT Acc Bbs play)</I>
<BR><I>YEAR 30:&nbsp; 4805 resources</I>
<BR><I>YEAR&nbsp; 40:&nbsp; ~11000 resources (Some terraforming already
done)</I>
<BR><I>YEAR 50:&nbsp; 20446 resources (sheet does not give exact figures,
but planet report does!!)</I>

<P>Let‘s have a closer look at the numbers of year 50:

<P>20446 resources (I think I could’ve done better – see above).

<P><I>I had (only) 27 of ~125 available planets, which really is around
1 in 4, but close to 1 in 5, but:</I>
<BR><I>There were still 6 green ones left on the edge of the universe map
as well as 13 big or medium yellows. I had</I>
<BR><I>already discovered all planets, of course. So the possible max number
of planets (disregarding a significant</I>
<BR><I>number of little yellows) could have been increased by an additional
19. This makes a total of 46 in 125, which is</I>
<BR><I>better than 1 in 3.</I>

<P><I>8 of these planets were 80% or&nbsp; better, 4 could still be terraformed
to this value. More than half of the total (14)</I>
<BR><I>were 50 % or better, the worst one could still be terraformed to
a value of 45%. Bear in mind,that much</I>
<BR><I>terraforming technology was not yet discovered, as you can see,
looking at the tech levels.</I>

<P><I>Tech was at 43 levels (costing twice the normal amount due to slower
tech adv setting), which is 3 levels more</I>
<BR><I>than I achieved with a slightly weaker economy and two techs set
at normal cost(!), distributed 5_10_6_10_5_7,</I>
<BR><I>giving me cruisers with colladials, pulsed sappers and/or delta
torpedoes. Besides I had smart bombs and</I>
<BR><I>organic armor (both bio tech 7), the possum scanner (300 ly range
with NAS), the stealth cloak, at least</I>
<BR><I>terraforming +/-7 everywhere (+/-11 in radiation) and the any/300
stargate. Some important items were only 1</I>
<BR><I>single turn away from discovery:&nbsp; e.g. the galleon, gattling
gun, M80 bomb or the scoper 220 (440 ly range with</I>
<BR><I>NAS). Please remember, that the slower tech adv setting makes all
tech twice as expensive as in a normal game!</I>

<P>I could have saved some resources if I had used medium transporters
with a fuel pod instead of my privateers
<BR>with a cargo and 2 fuel pods (optional: 3 fuel pods), but therefor
I would have lost some speed and – more
<BR>importantly – some Germanium, so I took that decision.

<P><I>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time (yet) to test this race with
acc bbs start (as I did in the former version of</I>
<BR><I>this article), but I think that over 20k resources in 2450 with
a normal start and a so called non economic race is</I>
<BR><I>evidence enough.</I>

<P>If you look at the results now and compare them with your own races
or with listings on other websites, there
<BR>can only be one conclusion: this is not only a real quickstart race-design,
but also a hyperproducing one. I would
<BR>not call it an hypergrowth one (though it is a fast growing one), as
expansion depends a lot on playing style:
<BR>grabbing many planets early in offensive style or picking the better
ones and playing rather a cautious, defensive
<BR>game – whatever you prefer, this is the IT-race to do it.

<P><I>Well, no records, but I’m really satisfied with the performance <B>now
</B>(considering the testbed settings).</I> Still some
<BR>reserves in more concentrated gameplay and more G on Planet2 (allowing
freighters instead of privateers); also,
<BR>beeing IT, in a real game you could gain a lot from diplomacy. You
may not be guaranteed to win a game with
<BR>these settings, but you will have fun competing (I had). If you do
not like the results, or if you think they are
<BR>insufficent for multiplayer games on the net, please let me know. I’d
appreciate some suggestions for
<BR>improvement!

<P><B>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tips</B>

<P>If you’ve read all this carefully, you will already have discovered
some tips on gameplay and diplomacy. You
<BR>still want some more? Ok:

<P>Maybe I’ll also be writing something more about gameplay, if the reactions
on this one are positive. By the way,
<BR>there are some fine articles about IT for beginners available at different
websites (containing lots of gameplay
<BR>tips).
<BR>I’wont write anything more about diplomacy, first, because I don’t
have enough multiplay-experience, second,
<BR>because the Scott Phelps diplomacy series (8 parts I think) is a lot
better than I ever could do and is available
<BR>everywhere.

<P>Any sort of reaction is appreciated (except about my poor English).
If you have suggestions on IT race-design, or
<BR>if you want to inform me about game (-testbed) results with this race,
or if you want to share your favourite race-
<BR>design (of whatever PRT) with me, please send me an e-mail to the following

<P>If you want to publish this on your website, just go ahead. But, please,
if you do so, don’t change the text and
<BR>credit me as the author, leaving my name and e-mail address within.
If you want to do me an xtra favour, send
<BR>me a short e-mail of where to find your website, on which you published
it. As my native language is German,
<BR>you can imagine that this was not written in a few minutes (why don’t
you try to write something in a foreign
<BR>language?). Thank you.

<P>Greetings to all Stars!-freaks in the Universe
<BR>(If you are keen on my other PRT-designs now, why don’t you just send
an e-mail?)
