<h3>Defending Against the Horde - Updated<br>
by: Red Dragon</h3>

<p>I would like to give a few pointers, since your situation is not
necessarily a hopeless one. (This article has been posted from the Newsgroup, and deals primarily with how to defend one's Empire from a "gang" of smaller entities - barbarians at the gate. - Omonubi)<br><br>

<p>Reflecting back on what I had wrote in my previous post (and seeing
all the terrible grammar and spelling errors;-), I wanted to collect
my thoughts and add some more stuff on various points and also explain
some other tactics that can be employed (which are taken from
Musashi's work as indicated below) for this post (with less spelling
and grammar errors ;-)<br><br>

<p>1. Consider how much of a loss you are willing to accept (i.e border
worlds), while consolidating your inner worlds (defenses, factories,
research, and ship building)<br><br>
For this purpose:<br>
Select where you would like to put up a fight to erode their advances
if not completely halt it, and try evacuating the unnecessary border
worlds (this way they won't gain tech by invading your worlds, which
is a nasty advantage to give them so freely away) which are going to
be attacked. Make sure the evacuated points do not give them a
tactical/strategic advantage (like a neat road to your other planets),
unless you can live with such a future threat but you are sure of
holding them in their next destination point.<br><br>
Use the vacuated colonists in your inner colonies where ever you can
(either new starters, or medium ones). They will be slowly building up
(and if I understand correctly you have  a quick start design, so they
should be able to do something there). Since they will be secure for a
while, they will be your med-long term source of income.<br><br>

<p>Additional:<br><br>

<p>Don't try to establish yourself in their sector when you manage to
take over planets from your enemy! I know this is very unconventional,
but the following pointers should help you understand:<br><br>

<p>a.  Your time to front vs. their time to front is not equal (see also
relevant discussion on Mystery Guild about war strategy, how the fleet
deployment times affect the outcome of any war effort). Basically, you
will be fighting the war in their territory surrounded by their
planets and fleets. Since you are not IT, and cannot move fleets as
fast as an IT, establishing yourself inside enemy territory do not
work for you as it does for an IT (and even for IT, it might be
troublesome). They will be able to come against you with better ships
then you can defend, because there will be a deployment lag for you
compared to their relative instantaneous deployment. -  And similar
considerations as elaborated more in various strategy articles located
at Mystery Guild.<br><br>

<p>b.  This will give an opportunity to them to fight you in their terms,
and I do not mean the repetition of statement "a". Not only will they
have superiority (following "a"), but also gives them a chance to gain
tech or other benefits by re-invading the planet. (As a side note, if
I were them, I would allow you to grow for a while in my territory,
while harassing your fleets that will try to support that planet,
forcing you to commit resources, energy to that particular campaign,
and finally, when the time is ripe - like you reaching a higher tech
level - I would invade, collecting the fruits of my recently planted
"alien" tree! ;-)<br><br>

<p>c.  Since it is just the start of a major war (or a war in the
making), the enemy is probably still euphoric or still cock-sure about
what they can do and what they cannot do (especially if they had
managed some small victories at certain sectors). Therefore, your
initial success at securing a planet in their sector, although will be
a blow to their pride and psychology, and a moral boost to you, it can
and will wear off quite fast, when they collectively think about it
and the ways they can try and get that planet back (which turns the
tide against you again with several gains lost, and advantages
surrendered to the enemy). So better don't give them the chance and
the moral boost which will follow, after their initial loss of pride
and security when you have taken over the planet. Let them simmer.
Move in and move out!<br><br>

<p>Alternatives:<br><br>

<p>Since you should not use the planet as a temporary base as discussed
above, there are other things you can do. Obtain all the minerals you
can (Sun Tzu "obtain your bread and water from the enemy" - In fact
he also said obtain your weapons from the enemy, but it's a pity
Stars! don't allow you to capture enemy ships to use against the enemy
;-).<br><br>

<p>Attack any other easy preys around (like small colonies, unarmed
ships, etc) Lay minefields. Use diplomacy to show the particular
enemy how easy it was for you to attack him and kill his planet
(Gunboat diplomacy!).  Even if you don't attack (because there are no
favorable targets, keep your fleet around (well in a way, this is
almost contradictory to what I am saying further below in one of the
sections, when I am talking about tying their fleets to a campaign,
because now I am advising you to tie your fleet to a sector), but it
has the advantage of carrying the war to their doorstep,
asking/forcing them to engage you. Even if you know you can't do
damage, they don't know that (but they will know definitely any of
your ships could be presented with windows of opportunity at any time,
or can cause lots of problems with their shipping lanes), so they have
to react. (Musashi- injuring the corners, see later sections!)<br><br>

<p>They have to commit some fleets to hunt and kill you. If you can play
hide and seek, you are asking them to tie some of their resources in
their territory instead of allowing them to use those resources in
your own territory against you. Therefore, less enemy resources being
used actively against you where they would have done the most damage
against you, the better off you are and more time you gain.
Action = Reaction, and that's what initiative is all about in a matter
of speaking. You should Act! and NOT React! (Forestalling the enemy,
taking the initiative - Musashi, see later sections!)<br><br>

<p>The only time I can think of when it's best to establish yourself in
enemy territory is when all the conditions are favorable:<br><br>

<p>a. You have clear lines of logistics to support/defend the invaded
point.<br><br>

<p>b. Your deployment time to the planet is not too long or you have
means to make it short.<br><br>

<p>c. The interim period when you will be vulnerable to enemy action is a
short period with not too many risks or you have temporarily air
superiority or have some means of delaying enemy fleets (like own mine
fields), which will allow you to establish yourself for a longer
period or get more re-enforcement's to support your command center.<br><br>

<p>d. The invaded planet is positioned such that it is secure from many
sides (that is closed on 2-3 sides) with only one clear line of attack
from the enemy which you might be able to use to choke the enemy
fleets by ambushes or some similar methods - (Sun Tzu - "uncrossable
terrain, slow terrain..")<br><br>

<p>e. You have clear route for escape/evacuation, when it's time to run
away ;-)<br><br>

<p>In your current situation, however, being forced to defend your own
territory, and answers to enemy attacks at several points, the above
favorable conditions do not necessarily mean you should establish
yourself in enemy territory. Over stretching yourself will be the
undoing of your empire. Establish yourself, when you have the
opportunity and the resources to do so, without endangering your other
campaigns elsewhere, especially home ground defense. If you want to
setup a short-term base, even though you will be stretching yourself
to the limit, do so knowing that you will have to pull out. (Crossing
at a ford- Musashi applies here also, see later sections!)<br><br>

<p>Most important:<br><br>

<p>Plan ahead, to kick some butt before pulling out or use the temporary
base as a bargaining point (Gunboat diplomacy) against a weaker
opponent to get him out of the picture.
Use the base as an intel source. Do kamikaze runs with your known
designs against his main production centers to obtain their latest
ship designs and base designs. Since they will be deployed somewhere,
(and if they are clever they will not use it on their home ground to
keep you in the dark, until they are at your border worlds) most of
these designs will be used eventually against you. At least the intel
will give you enough time to counterdesign and meet them since your
deployment time vs. theirs will be shorter when you are defending. You
will be making their designs obsolete by the time they come out of the
production queue ;-)  (This is a slight variation on Moving the Shade
- Musashi, to obtain enemy strategy, in this case enemy ship designs
and preparing yourself. See later sections!)<br><br>

<p>One more note; if you know you will pull out don't start building
factories, and mines! - Defenses - yes!, but not factories and mines -
unless you are going to stay there for quite a long while! (No point
giving a planet back Gift Wrapped! ;-) And collect all your bread and
weapons (minerals, whatever), before pulling out and do poison the
water wells (lay mine fields!)<br><br>

<p>2. Choose the fight you are going to engage in. Whether it's their
attack fleet, defending your planet or some other target. And also the
time and where you are going to fight it. What I mean is this:<br><br>
<li>are you going to try to gain time until you can get victory at
particular point?
<li>are you trying to consolidate your superiority at a particular
point?
<li>are you trying to harass their fleet, attack force? until you
can effectively deal with them when your new ships arrrive!
<li>are you trying to gain tech from them? (this sometimes is
quite efficient, then yourself doing a research. when you need some
tech, and you are spending all your resources for ship building, it
may be good idea to choose an enemy fleet that may not meet any
criteria for strategic planning like securing a point, weakening
enemy's overall presence, etc... but where they have few ships with
new tech which you can gain if you strike at them and win that
particular fight, giving you tech advance!) remember that as much as
you are spending resources for fleet build-up to defend/attack they
all have to do the same, and sometimes, they have to push forward,
because a lengthened war is a severe drain in their economy, and may
cause them to fall behind in tech levels to sustain the attacks. While
you are gaining tech from several well chosen skirmishes. This is also
why you should stay away from fights which you might loose or allow
them invade a border planet (if you have the choice of pulling back or
evacuating).<br><br>

<p>An example is from my previous game: I had TGFS engines, bear shield
and Jihads with CCs, my enemy had Juggs, wolverine, fuel mizer with
CCs. I declined to engage his jugg ships unless I was sure I could win
the fight, and finally when he had sent a few ccs to intercept  a
freighter/mine layer fleet, I intercepted his few CCs with 3 times
larger CC fleet. I had better battle speed and better shields, thus
managed to kill his ccs and gained the weapons tech, which helped me
to match him not only in weapons but also managed to prevent him
gaining beter engine and shield techs.<br><br>

(this point was partly on, Injuring the
Corners, and Crossing at a Ford - Musashi, but modified for a
particular situation. See later sections!)<br><br>

<p>3. Keep handy a few old scouts or DDs, that your enemy knows about
with your fleets and planets. They will be useful to intercept their
scouts or similar ships (the lambs they sent against you to get your
starbae or new ship designs by a kamikaze run); decline them intel on
your new ships wherver possible. Unless they are willing to gamble I
will bet on the fact that they will be hesitant to attack your new
ships without knowing what are they made off, unless of course they
are sure of their weapons superiority. If you have equal or slightly
larger number of ships of unknown design that will put a quick stop to
their advance into your territory. This is especially good if you had
gained a few tech levels (and is advertised on the score board) which
might not be necessarilly a tech gain in shields, armour or weapons,
but some other tech branch, use the opportunity to vary your existing
design with a better one with your current or old tech (in  such a way
that you are not filling a ship slot for nothing but to address a
specific ship desing need for the interim period). It serves 2
purposes. You will have a new design they have no idea of, that can
serve several purposes (to match one of their design, or some other
specific purpose), and also make them stop to investigate your new
design before attacking blindly not knowing whether you have improved
weaponsy or shield or armour or whatever. Using old ship design to
attack their scouts decline the intel or attack their fleets to gain
time until you can build up the new ships at a specific place. This
will not give them the new tech even if you loose (what I found to be
true is, even if your oponent is technologically superior, engaging
his old tech ship don't give any tech advances to you even if he
looses the battle. To gain the tech, you have to attack and win over
his new tech ships!)<br><br>

<p>(This point was partly on Injuring the Corners, and also most
important,  about the most elemental knowledge - the "Ai Uchi"! See
later sections!)<br><br>

<p>4. If you see his bombers or freighter ships (for bombing/invading
your colonies), try kamikaze runs by selecting those ships as main
targets with the required battle orders. Make sure  a few of your
ships can survive the enemy firepower and manage to kill his bombers
and freighters. He may be able to advance and shoot down your
starbase, whatever, but cannot do more, as he needs to wait for new
bombers or freighters. Gaining you valuable time. He may even have to
keep his attack fleet in orbit until his bombers/freighters arrive,
keeping his fleet tied up preciously, while you are cooking more
surprises for him. <br><br>

<p>As long as they don't bring freighters or bombers (or waiting for
them), you don't need to build up another port or SB or whatever (for
what purpose, if your SB or port is outnumbered.... so that you loose
precious minerals, resources?) Instead you can divert the resources
for something useful like defenses, mines, factories or research.
Every single penny(resource) counts.<br><br>

<p>When bombers or freighters are coming or are already arrived with the
attacking fleet, then it's a different ball game. Putting up even an
unarmed port is good to prevent them from bombing (against dropping
colonists this may not work as your port will be shot down). Building
your defenses and keeping them built up is a good idea.<br><br>

<p>If you can fool them by holding 1-2 turns by not building any port or
starbase while they have their war ships and bombers/whatever in
orbit, and just building an attack port or base on the 3rd turn you
may get lucky enough to shoot down their bombers/freighters or part of
their warships, if they move their war ships (or part of it) out of
orbit, as they might be lead to believe that your resources or mineral
too low for you to build anything dangerous for their ships, and they
want to press their attack leaving bombers/freighters to do the
remaining job. It's a gamble but can work. When your enemy is devoting
his economy to war, knowing his economy is declining, his tech levels
are levelling off, he will want to act as fast as possible, and hasty
moves on his part are your opportunity to strike. An enemy fleet tied
down bacause of a bombing campaign is a fleet out of action, one fleet
less for you to deal with, while you have opportunity to attack
another point. Considering his economy relative to yours, any action
from your side that involves him to keep his fleets tied down at any
point is a big advantage. You can bear the loss of a planet more than
he can, and while you are at it, try to get him devoting more and more
resources to gain that planet from you. <br><br>

<p>Additional:<br><br>

<p>Have you ever considered how much it really costs to build bomber
fleets to wipe out planets, especially in the mid-game tech levels? It
can really put a dent in the economy (not only due to resources but
also mineral requirements) which can be used to build more warships or
factories or supporting the economy and defenses. Few bomber fleets
destroyed mean, you effectively put half of the enemy's war campaign
out of commission. - In my latest games I had to tread very carefully
to make sure that my bomber fleets were secured before I deployed them
because, I could not afford to loose a few bomber ships which would
require me to spend part of my economy to build bombers whereas I
needed all my resources divided between warship building and research.<br><br>


<p>If you cannot bomb the enemy, what use is it to attack his planets -
ok! Attack his fleets, I understand, there's a tangible gain there and
damage done to enemy, but if you cannot kill his planets, you are
asking yourself to be sunk slowly in a swamp Prolonging the war is
screwing up your economy, and you are not helping yourself at all. The
opponent's economy is also not doing very well, but who is going to
win it? The guy with the better resources of course. So even if there
are several small scale empires going against you, you should consider
the individual empire on an individual basis, and that's when you can
realize how fortunate you are, because you have a larger scale economy
to deal with them. I know. Sometimes you get lost or overwhelmed in
tiny details (seeing all those enemy ships converging from several
points), but the important thing is keeping your head cool, being
selective, anticipating enemy movements, and never loosing sight of
the big picture, the importance of relative scales of economy between
you and them. (cutting the enemy, not slashing him, as explained
partly in Ai Uchi!)<br><br>

<p>And that's why a loss of fleet to enemy firepower resulting with the
destruction of their bomber fleets in a kamikaze run can have such a
tremendous effect on them. Copying a similar idea from Sun Tzu and
modifying it; when your troops are attacking and you need heavy
artillery, you cannot afford to wait for the heavy artillery, it has
to be there, when and where you require it. If enemy destroys your
heavy artillery, you better pack your things and go home!<br><br>

<p>5. If you cannot win a fight, you can divert that fleet for another
job, like threatening to attack his planets. Yes, you will probly
loose a planet your fleet is defending, but you'll loose it anyway,
because his fleet will kill your defending fleet. Why not position
that fleet to attack his planets. After all, you have more planets and
he has less, so you can afford to loose that planet where as he can't
(at least not for very long). He has to make a choice between
attacking you or defending his planet. And you don't need really
hi-tech ships for that, since your economy is bigger, you should be
able to produce more ships of slightly lesser or equal tech to pose a
real threat to his planets.<br><br>

<p>You cannot expect to be everywhere, and anytime, and win it. You have
to make choices, selections, and be scientifically objective,
systematic and cool about it War is always a mess, but you can sure
try make some sense out of it. You have to learn when and what to
forfeit/sacrifice. This is what the Japanese Sword Saint Miyamoto
Musashi meant in his book Go Rin No Sho (Book of Five Rings) 400 years
ago, when he was writing about "Crossing at a ford!" You know you are
treading dangerous waters, you have to cross the big water at some
point, but how and when and where If you can manage to make the right
choices for how, when and where, then you will be successful. At
times, you will have favorable conditions and you start on your
journey, but the conditions change, when you are just within reach of
your destination (like a ships sailed with good wind, but the wind
changes direction), then you have to try your best options to reach
the destination (like rowing the last few miles to the shore). <br><br>

<p>6. Facing several oponents at once is quite de-moralizing, I know as I
have been in that position few times. The first thought is "It's
hopeless, they are almost 2-3 times of my empire, combined together".
But it is a real misconception. Resourcewise they may be, but that
only accounts for ship building. If all of them are building ships,
they can build 2-3 times your fleet size. Which will force you meet
them when situations are favourable (as I was explaining in the above
sections). However respectively their economies will be strained, and
they cannot keep it up for prolonged periods. Not only they have to
consider their economic situation, but their relative game position,
because they have to realize that sooner or later, they will fall
behind each other or behind other players who are not fighting the
war.<br><br>

<p>They all have to divert their resources for tech research individually
to have an edge against you as well as for later phase of the game
against each other. Not one of them can afford to loose on tech or
economics, so they have to divide their attention to research and
economics, which will slow down or stop their ship building phase at
intervals. There's also a duplication involved. They can streamline a
tech exchange program to alleviate the situation but still it's
another thing they have to co-ordinate apart from their war effort,
whereas you will be co-ordinating single handed, with less
distractions, and possibly less mistakes.<br><br>

<p>Each oponent is a potential source for choice: their fleets, properly
selected and engaged will give you tech gain benefits.
It will also give you the choice of making better use of your fleets,
like choosing an oponent whose particular fleet you can kill because
you are superior in tech (if not in numbers), or you are superior in
numbers but not in tech (thus potential gain for a new tech level...
maybe...)<br><br>
<p>They will not have much choice in the conflicts as long as you take
the initiative, and make the arrangements on behalf of them ;-)<br><br>

<p>Having a fleet of some sort (even if it's no match for their fleet) is
better then having nothing. You can keep a presence around their
bombers, freighters which they have to escort or divert ships for
protection, effectively reducing their mobility and movement. - I
learnt a nice lesson from one of the best 2 years ago, when he told me
that instead of engaging his BBs with my CC fleet (which of course got
wiped out), if I had only kept around but not engaged, it would have
tied his BB fleets too long for him to continue with his other
campaigns. In effect he was bombing my planets 1 at a time until I
lost my CC fleet, after that he was bombing my planets 3-4  at a time,
while attacking and killing off 2 starbases in the meantime. I was
awaiting BB tech at the time. Goes to show you, how important not to
concede complete air superiority to the other player. If I had kept my
fleet around harassing his bombers, he had to take his time, giving me
enough time to get the BB tech and start giving him more resistance.<br><br>

<p>Due to their economic size, and how they are positioning their fleets,
you have choice of whether attacking/engaging their fleets or their
planets forcing them to re-think their situation. <br><br>

<p>There is also the common problems of such a crowded alliance of some
sort. There is the necessary issues of maintaining the empire - "Damn,
I need to get my planet X up to a certain level...., or need to Build
that starbase...., or need to research that tech level....", which
forces the alliance member to think "well, members A and B are
attacking ther and there, so I  can slow down my war effort and divert
resources to......". This tendency will slowly creep in and put a nice
dampener into their seemingly co-ordinated attack. Especially in case
one of their valuable assets is being threatened by you.<br><br>

<p>The personal situations of each empire forces the player to take a
different course of action at one point eventually. Usually the first
one to buckle under such stress is the weaker player. You don't need
to go for the kill, enough to get him of your back, and deal with the
others, unless the opportunity to kill him is presented quite quickly
in which case you should kill him. In a way you should fight a gurilla
war, which they should have done against you in the first place. <br><br>

<p>Your responsibility is to remind them of this eventuality either by
diplomacy, or by military action of some sort (like engaing his
fleets, planets, or declining an opportunity for an engagement!).<br><br>

<p>Play for the long term. You are going to fight a long war, and will
need minerals. Roughly, if their total number of planets are equal to
yours, make best use of your minerals, knowing that in the end they as
well as you will be facing mineral shortages. However, if you can keep
major portion of your empire together, you will be better of compared
to your enemies individually. Each of them will be producing less
minerals then you would be (everything being more or less equal, and
you having more planets then they have individually).<br><br>

<p>If you can conserve your minerals, by saving your fleets where
required and getting them where it counts, you are investing in your
future. <br><br>

<p>You have to concentrate getting your inner worlds and uncolonized
worlds up and running. This is your inner territoy, your sanctum
snctorum, where everything should be secure, and slowly building up
for the final stage, away from prying eyes and enemy attacks. You
cannot expand since you are having  a war, but you can expand
internally where possible. You enemies will be too busy to deal with
you then to expand (except towards your territory), but how much of it
they will be able to use?<br><br>

<p>And don't supply them with minerals. Try not only to evacuate the
border worlds where possible, and not worth fighting for unless there
will be some sort of gain (time, tech, or tying up enemy resources),
but also evacuate all the minerals, etc.. and if possible force him to
bomb it out of existence all your factories and mines. If you cannot
evacuate, use your minerals to build starbase, etc.. to get rid of
them so they cannot be used by the enemy when finally they take it
over.<br><br>

<h3>What Musashi wrote, some examples:<bR><br>

<p>The following are explanations of some teachings which are mostly from
Musashi's Book of Five Rings (I chose that as it seems it is not as
well known as the Chinese Sun Tzu's work, and I also happen to be
interested in Martial Arts spirit and teachings)<bR><br>

<p>The most important thing to remember and learn is "To become the
Enemy" (Musashi). This means thinking yourself into the enemy's
position. Usually in your situation, people always have the impression
that the enemy is strong, and they tend to be cautious. But if you
have good etch, resources, ships, and sound strategies, and you have a
good understanding of the strategies and your stronger points and
their weaker points, and you know how to beat an enemy, then there is
really no point in worrying. It is distracting at worst to worry. My
previous notes were to point out what you have and what they have, and
allow you understand the situation and look at it from a different
perspective. Thus show a way to tell you  To Become the Enemy.<br><br>

<p>The following are also important:<br>
Attitude-No Attitude (Musashi) - This is from Japanese Martial Art
"Kendo/Kenjutsu" (sword fighting art). You have several principal
sword attitudes from which you can attack, parry, defend and change
into another attitude. The ultimate knowledge is an opening attitude
called Attitude of No Attitude, which is a technique where your
attitude do not show your intentions, where you can switch from one
attitude to the other swiftly and fluently, and always with the intent
on cutting the enemy. Whatever you do, do not try to slash or strike
or touch the enemy but cut the enemy (in a matter of speaking), when
you are parrying, locking or moving. Your intent should be killing
him, not damaging, wounding him. When you are attacking him you should
be able to cut him, or following your move through, you should be able
to carry on and cut him.  <br><br>

<p>Referring back to the attacking and killing enemy bombers If the
enemy is attacking you with warships while he's waiting for his
bombers, he's not cutting you or killing you, so he's effectively
making a big mistake. He's probably expecting to follow through the
killing action with his bombers, but what good it will do him if he
had been slashing at you and you destroy his bombers? He had only
managed to slash you but not cut you.<br><br>

<p>This teaching is also similar to another teaching called "Ai Uchi",
cutting the enemy as he cuts you. This is the first lesson and it is
the last, in a way, because it encompasses all the knowledge and the
spirit to win. You have to know the timing, the rhythm, and respond
with good timing and a concentrated spirit. To learn the timing you
have to have a certain lack of fear and anger. In fact Ai Uchi means
lack of anger, and abandoning your life, throwing away your fear, not
concerning yourself with winning or loosing, because if it comes it
will come (like all Japanese phrases, this phrase contains so many
meanings, translations, symbolism). <br><br>

<p>Concentrate on the job at hand. Learn to respect your enemy and treat
him like an honored guest while cutting him. This all sounds a bit
mystical confusing and looks like it can only apply to real-life
situations or only to Kendo/Kenjutsu, but in fact you can apply the
principles to anything really. If you know/heard something about
Bushido (the code of honor for the Samurai) and Samurai's, the way of
warrior is death, and resolute acceptance of death, and these are what
Ai Uchi is about.<br><br>

<p>When there are many enemies (Many Enemies- Musashi):<br>
The method is to chase the enemies from side to side even though they
come from different directions. Observe their attacking order and meet
the first attacker carefully. Don't wait, keep moving, as a stationary
position is always death and movement is life (like empty and full,
yin and yang). Get collected after each attack, and focus. Try to
drive the enemy together, pile them up so that you can go through and
cut them. This also is a reflection on taking the initiative by acting
and creating reaction as explained previously, forcing the enemy to
meet you whenever possible.<br><br>

<p>Forestalling the enemy:<br><br>

<p>When I was talking about attacking the enemy instead of defending a
planet, previously, I was also talking about slowing down or
forestalling the enemy. According to Musashi there are 3 ways to
forestall an enemy:<br><br>
<li>Forestall by attacking (which is obvious and explained before)
<li>Forestall him as he attacks (which was also explained before, and
descriptive in itself)
<li>Forestall him when you and him are attacking each other.  This is
basically accompanying him and forestalling him. <br><br>

<p>All the three methods are main means of taking the lead, the
initiative. And initiative is what counts to gain victory in most
cases.<br><br>

<p>Collapse:<br><br>

<p>This is recognizing the point when the enemy is collapsing, and
pursuing them without any let-up to gain the victory. If you read the
paragraphs about weaker opponent, etc.. you will see that it is when
the enemy is collapsing and when you have to pursue the advantage. If
you don't take advantage, then you they may recover (however, I had
also explained my reservations, when not to pursue your advantage if
you are going to stretch yourself to your limits or, if other things
require your immediate attention, and the weaker opponent can wait
another day to be killed. Otherwise kill him and kill him
immediately).<br><br>

<p>For later stages, you can apply a quite well known technique (called
Moving the Shade - Musashi):<br><br>

<p>If you cannot see or find out enemy strategy, plans, or position,
indicate that you are going to attack with a strong force, to discover
his resources. This can be done by positioning a large fleet at a
particular point (especially in a central position), where the enemy
has the chance to funnel his fleets also to defend or counter-attack
you. He has shown his hand, and probably with all his reserves
accounted for also in that same fleet. Then it's time to choose a
strategy to defeat him by re-thinking your options and resources and
re-positioning them. <br><br>

<p>Your ever changing or ever stable actions will also affect the enemy.
When the enemy is agitated, rushing, if you are calm, and acting as if
you don't mind his action at all, he'll be surprised, and will be
taken-in. His attitude will change to a relaxation (thinking he has
the time to further build up his forces). This is called "passing on
the spirit". You are reflecting an image that is unexpected and
unthreatening, that gives a sense of no imminent danger. That's the
point when you should attack strongly when your enemy is lulled into a
false sense of security and relaxation. This tactic is best achieved
when you had crushed quite a bit of enemy forces, and when you are not
following up on the attacks while he's desperately trying to gather
his remaining forces. He'll be inclined to spend a bit more time on
gathering his forces, building up a bit his economy or research more
tech levels to get that next new toy, which he'll never have the time
to use or build when you attack.<br><br>

<p>And my last addition to the above notes is a tactic which I had seen
previously thrown away or advised against it in some strategy
documents - especially in one document, where you are definitely asked
to attack the major centers and not the small targets. In general
that's a sound tactic/advise, but not always applicable or practical.
And considering your economy vs. theirs, you might get away with the
following easily. It's a tactic of attrition of some sorts.<br><br>

<p>Injuring the Corners - Musashi: Sometimes it is difficult to move
strong things by pushing directly, (like attacking major centers
defended strongly), so you should "injure the corners".
In large-scale strategy, it is beneficial to strike at the corners,
like in swordplay, if the opponent is strong why not hit his shoulder,
and dislocate it, he'll not be able to wield the sword with that arm
any more. You have not damaged the body, but injured a corner. Few
more corners and the body collapses, ripe for a kill. Same thing with
enemy targets. Unarmed ships, bomber fleets, undefended colonies are
all corners of the enemy to be injured. (and if you remember my advise
to you to pull out of border worlds, where there's no practical gains
of any sort, like holding a strategic point, or defending a position
to gain time, then you will see that I am trying to prevent you to
fall into a position where your corners are being injured!)<br><br>

<p>And always remember when you are fighting a war, due to the way you
are interacting with the enemy, you will at times be lost in detail.
You will be pre-occupied with the small details. You must then change
into another spirit-larger spirit, interchanging the small details
with the larger picture, keep the bigger picture in sight What's the
benefit of concentrating on one particular skirmish and win it while
you are loosing ground at another sector where the enemy is slowly
building up its presence for a new front to attack against you or
opening a gateway/route to your empire? <br><br>

<p>Any comments are welcome. For your information Musashi's work was
translated by several people and been published. It's quite an
interesting reading material, although most of it is quite lacking in
detail, as the knowledge is based on Kenjutsu and Kendo, and requires
practice in the martial art and then discussion of the spiritual
teaching based on the learnt/practiced practical techniques. However
quite many of them also are practically applicable to almost any given
situation.<br><br>
