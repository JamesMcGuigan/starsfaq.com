Remote Mining. Is it worth it? If so, just how much? What designs work best? The purpose of this article is to help answer some of these questions. If you have any comments or suggestions, please, let me know.<br><br>

Philosophy: IS remote mining actually worth it? In my opinion, yes, depending on the characteristics of one's race design. Advanced Remote Mining (ARM) is an expensive LRT, but can pay off enourmous dividends in minerals. This is very good if you find your planets constantly running low on Ironium, but can be a waste if your race does not take advantage of resource efficiency.<br><br>

This whole concept is based around what I call the "Resource Production Limiter", or RPL. If a particular race does not produce enough resources, it can find itself with mineral reserves far in excess of what can realistically be applied to ship construction. Of course, these excess minerals can always be "offloaded" as packet weapons. However, packet weapons are very "expensive", not only to operate but also to build. That 4000kt packet of Boranium could build alot of beam weapons.<br><br>

A good way of measuring RPL is in Capitol Ship Units, or CSUs. A nice goal is to be able to build at least 1 capital ship from each major shipyard per turn. This would be a CSU of 1. Two CSUs per turn is ideal, and very hard to achieve at any one particular location, at any one time. I have seen many races with lots of minerals, but a very low CSU, due to race design limitations imposed in the Resource Efficiency section of the Race Wizard. This leads to piles of minerals that can easily be captured by your enemies and used against you. Remote mining under these circumstances can become a liability in this respect.<br><br>

There is no easy way to determine a balance between mineral excavation and RPL - it just takes practice and experience. In my games, it seems to be better to be short on minerals, with a low RPL, rather than the opposite. What good are all those minerals, if you can't use them? Every slot you use for mining hulls is one less that can be used for other types of vessels. In addition, races with a high RPLs (less resource efficiency) also suffer from slow technology advances. This can lead to literally hundreds of vessels in each class, making it much harder to micro-manage fleet resources due to commitments of older designs in strategic deployment.<br><br>

</p>

<h4>Colonization vs. Mining:<br>
</h4>
<p>One of the biggest factors to consider when building remote mining vessels, is the simple question of which is better? Mining planets with your own people, or relying on vulnerable mining ships for the job? Of course, if you are AR, this is not a problem, but for the rest of the PRTs, this MUST be taken into account.<br><br>

Consider that, with mining efficiency set to the standard 10/5/10 (see below), a population of 100,000 colonists can mine 100kts of minerals (assuming maximum concentrations), at a cost of 500 resources to build those mines.<br><br>

In comparison, it would require approximately 12-13 mini-miners, equipped with mini-miner robots, to accomplish the same results at a cost of over 2,000 resources (plus minerals). This makes remote mineral excavation 4 to 5 times more expensive. Just imagine if you improve your races mineral efficiency.<br><br>

What, then, are the advantages of remote mining? Mobility of operations and Immunity from planetary environmental factors. Mining vessels often find themselves deployed around worlds that are very inhospitable to colonization. Even small "green" worlds require far more equipment and materials to place 100,000 colonists on than simply deploying a small group of remote miners. While miners require military protection, their ability to move makes them a renewable resource, in this respect.<br><br>

Factor in the larger, more cost efficient mineral ship designs possible and remote mining begins to make alot of sense. <br><br>

But what if you are HE with tri-immunity? Do the math - you may still find remote mining more profitable than colonizing every world you can. With a mineral efficiency of 12/3/16 (see below), a population of 1,000,000 can remote mine 1200kt of minerals per year, at a cost of 3000 resources to build said mines. An Ultra Miner, equipped with Ultra Robots can excavate 300kts for a cost of 600 resources, plus minerals - they're cheaper. By the way, it costs 50 points during race creation to get the ARM used in this example, and 225 points to get the 12/3/16 stats used.<br><br>

</p>

<h4>ARM vs. OBRM:<br>
</h4>
<p>Choosing the Only Basic Remote Mining LRT is a great way to score some extra points during race creation. If your race design fits with this choice, go for it, but at least test the race in a practice game before commiting it to a test against humans (who are so much more brutal). If you find your race chronically short on minerals at year 2450, just imagine how things will look in 2550. Usually, the best application for OBRM is to apply it to a lower resource efficient design, where mining efficiency is usually raised (HE with immunities is a prime example of this). Once again, the cost to increase mining efficiency for the race is going to be higher than the points gained by taking OBRM, but in cases of high habitability (immunities especially), the free growth rate of the local population at any one prospective planet can become an overwhelming factor in these equations.<br><br>

If your race possesses a low habitabilty (1 in 4, or worse), or if you are an AR PRT, OBRM can really be a mistake. Your only hope is that the Mystery Trader will swing by and give you Alien Miners for your hulls.<br><br>

Advanced Remote Mining (ARM) is the oposite. By expending some points, your remote mining ability increases dramatically, and the cost of remote excavators drops dramatically, really producing an advantage over colonial excavation. Additionally, with ARM, it is cheaper to build midget-miner hulls and robots than any other design, until the advent of ultra mining. This easily eliminates extraneous ship designs by providing superior remote mining ability in only two designs.<br><br>

Additionally, if "2 class" ARM plan is followed, Bleeding Edge Technology (BET) can provide the race in question with an insideous mining edge. Since a standard Midget-mining hull is produced for a long period of time, BET can dramatically further lower ship production costs, allowing literally hundreds of miners to be constructed in a short time.<br><br>

Of course, the third option in all of this is to choose neither - always a safe way to go. In fact, the flexibility in excavator desgin is so much better over OBRM, that it seems better to almost always opt for standard mineral technology, rather than grab the 80 or so extra points during race creation.<br><br>

Now on with the details of the equipment:<br>
GMU = Galactic Monetary Unit: A method of equivelating minerals and resources into a rational galactic-wide standard.<br><br>

1 GMU = 1kt Ironium/Germanium = 1 resource = 3 Boranium / These figures are purely for comparison purposes and do not reflect any sort of intrinsic value to an individual player.<br><br>

<p>In ranking, from highest to lowest, based on GMUs cost / kt of mineral mined: Alien, Ultra, Super, Maxi, Miner, Midget, and Mini (which is 2.6 times worse than the Midget robot).<br><br>

The Alien robot is the most efficient to build and deploy and definately worth using over almost all other models. The Ultra robot may be a better choice, as it allows smaller groups of ships to do more excavating (at a slightly increased cost). This is simply a matter of cost vs. micro-management.<br><br>

<h4>COMMENTS by Mr. Crosswell:<br>
</h4>
<p>>Probably my favorite two ways of measuring remote miners are the equivalent<br>
>mine cost and the return on ivestment (ROI) of Ironium.<br>
><br>
>For instance, if you build a ship that costs 300 resources and it can<br>
>mine 100kT/year on a 100% planet, then thats the equivalent of having<br>
>a Mines Cost 3. The ROI for Ironium is simply how many years it would<br>
>take that ship to mine as much Ironium as it took to make it. For<br>
>example, if the above ship took 200 kT of Ironium to build and can<br>
>mine 100kT/year, then its ROI for Ironium is 2 years. After that,
>everything else is profit.<br>
><br>
>If you plan on mining at a lower concentration, say an AR at a 30%<br>
>homeworld, then the ROI is 3.3 times longer since your mines are<br>
>less effective at the lower concentration.<br>
><br>
>Using the base cost of the items with no miniaturization, a typical<br>
>Ultra-Miner with 12 Robo-Ultra-Miners costs 823 resources. With a<br>
>mining capacity of 250kT/turn, this gives an equivalent of Mines<br>
>cost 2.7 with an ROI on Ironium of .77 years. (I used the Trans-Gal<br>
>fuel scoop and three Super Cloaks.) With typical midgame tech this<br>
>quickly drops to less than 2.5, and with maxed tech it drops to<br>
>something like 1.14 with an Ironium ROI of .3 years with 100%.<br>
>Those are some pretty cheap mines. And they much more effective than<br>
>planetaries because they can move to where the minerals are.<br>
><br>
>For regular miners the cost never gets quite that low. The Maxi-Miner<br>
>and Robo-Super-Miners at the basic cost start at Mines cost 4.5 and<br>
>an ROI on Ironium of 1.3 years with 100% conc. and ends up somewhere<br>
>around a mines cost 1.3 and an ROI on Ironium of about .4 years.<br>
><br>
>The main benefit of ARM is that the _initial_ miners are so much more<br>
>effective than anyone else's, and they weigh so much less. You can get<br>

>As soon as the ARM people get the Ultras, then they again get back the<br>

><br>
>And for OBRM, the cost per mine for remote miners starts at _35.6_ with<br>
>an ROI on Ironium of about _12 years_ at 100% conc. and eventually drops<br>

><br>
>One thing a lot of people overlook is the effectiveness of the Alien<br>

Ranking in hulls go as follows: Ultra, Midget, Maxi, Miner, and Mini. It is interesting to note the excellent cost advantages of the Midget miner vs. the Mini miner. Quite a cost difference indeed. The only advantage the Mini-miner has the extra slot - usefull for a fuel tank or scanner, but that's about it.<br><br>

The data pretty much speaks for itself, when comparing different miners and equipment. But what about those extra slots on the mining hulls? What to do with those?<br><br>

If you build lots of ships, placing scanners on your miners can really pay off, especially if you are fighting a SS race (or any race that uses extensive cloaking for that matter).<br><br>

Fuel tanks are always a favorite - especially if No Ram Scoops is choosen. <br><br>

Armor is good for durability, and the SD PRT will find it very handy to have its miners armored against exploding mine-fields.<br><br>

Defensive equipment, such as jammers, thrusters, etc., never made much sense to me - but some of you may feel otherwise. For miners, either offense (deploying armed escorts to the miners) or maneuverability seem a much better resolution to a military threat than any defensive measures one could take.<br><br>

Ultimately, any decision that one makes regarding this subject, can only really be based on practical experience, as every player utilizes the tools of Stars! in their own, unique ways. i hope this article was able to adequately display the differences regarding the different facets of remote mining, and that some of you may have learned something new in the course of reading it.<br><br>
