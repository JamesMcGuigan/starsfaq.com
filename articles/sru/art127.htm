Not an expert, but...<br><br>

<p>I managed to defeat a SS player in a game that is just completing. It
took some help from allies and I am sure that he had a lot more fun
playing a losing game against me with SS than I was beating him with my
HP JOAT. It has inspired me to try SS for the first time in a new game.
Here is my take on the overall strengths and weaknesses of the SS:<br><br>

<p>SS seem to be strong in the early and late game, but vunerable in the
middle. They expand well because their built in 75% cloaking is enough
to secretly colonize and pick off other players stray colonizers and
freighters. By the time borders have been established the SS should be
sitting quite fat and sassy.<br><br>

<p>The mid-game is a different story. Everyone has a SB up with a scanner
at their core worlds. They have frigate scanners on borders. The 75%
built in cloaking no longer gets the job done. They can be seen 50+ ly
away. SS need elec 10 to get the super stealth cloak to mantain their
stealth, but they also need to keep up in weap, const and ener or fall
easy prey to that first fleet of jihad cruisers that come to visit. They
simply do not have the economy to do this. Many races can keep their
tech near the top in 2 or even 3 categories, but not 4. This is a good
time to attack and at least steal back those border worlds that you
greatly covent. Later, you may wish you had delivered a fatal blow.<br><br>

<p>In the end game the SS become masters of the sneak attack. No planet is
safe from them! The unprotected planets fall prey to robber baron
attacks and even the strongest SB will be crushed by a 98% cloaked fleet
of BBs and bombers. They will know your latest BB design and you won't
know what or where their fleet is. You are worried and the SS payer is
having a blast.<br><br>
