    <td><font size="+2"><strong>Announcement - Stellar Legacy 0.2 (aka &quot;To 
      infinity, and beyond!&quot;)</strong></font><br> <br> <br>
      We are happy and proud to release the first public version of &quot;Stellar 
      Legacy&quot;. Stellar Legacy (SL) is an open source project aiming to create 
      a new Stars!-like game that's enjoyable to play and easy to expand. <br> 
      <br>
      The main goal of the Stellar Legacy Project is the creation of a free version 
      of the famous and beloved strategy game &quot;Stars!&quot; (tm). &quot;Free&quot; 
      means that the source code is freely available to everyone and that everyone 
      is free to modify and change the game in a way he likes. While we started 
      with the intention of creating a stars! clone our current goals are a bit 
      different since we found during the development process that stars! has 
      certain limitations we would like to overcome.<br> <br>
      A short and incomplete list of features SL has (aka &quot;whetting your 
      appetite&quot;) 
      <ul>
        <li> All files are human readable <br>
          (of course the player order files will be encrypted in the future)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> free as beer: it comes at no cost<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> free as speech: everyone can contribute to the project and modify 
          the code<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> multiplatform: standard c++ compiler and perl interpreter are sufficient<br>
          (we know that the current version runs under various versions of Linux 
          and also have some indications that it works on Windows)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> no limits for number of systems, planets, players, fleets, etc.<br>
          (there even can be more than one galaxy in the universe)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> Support for 2D and 3D galaxies<br>
          (the current code uses 2D galaxies)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> different implementations of the very same rule are possible<br>
          (this means that the current code base allows you to implement different 
          versions of the rule that calculates the fuel consumption, for example. 
          In this sense stars! will be a subset of Stellar Legacy)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Of course we do not want to withhold the bad side of life ;-)<br> <br>
      SL in this form is not ready for the usual strategy gamer. The primary audience 
      for version 0.2 are developers who are interested in joining a nice team 
      of Stars! addicts who are going to write the best turn-based strategy game 
      ever (hey, we need a goal!)<br> <br>
      So you stars! junkies out there, help us building the coolest turn based 
      strategy game. You might want to join our mailing list<br> <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/stellarlegacy-developer">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/stellarlegacy-developer</a><br> 
      <br>
      (has all the necessary details) and/or want to have a look at the current 
      API documentation to get an overview of the current (&gt;0.2) state:<br>

      <br>
      Also you might be interested that the SL user interface (SLUI) made some 
      progress. This client SLUI is in the CVS and will probably be part of the 
      0.3 version. First screenshots are here:<br> <a href="http://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/%7Ekrohn/sl/image-gallery/images.html">

      <br>
      </a>Instructions for downloading and running SL can be found in the appendix.Hope 
      to see some of you guys on our mailing list soon, otherwise you will hear 
      from us when 0.3 is ready :-)<br> <br>
      Best regards, <br>

      <strong>APPENDIX</strong><br> <br>
      Some specials for the adventurer and discoverers amongst you: 
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>What language SL is written in?</strong><br>
          With the exception of some smaller parts (see below) all the code is 
          written in pure C++.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>How much code have you guys written?</strong><br>
          sloccount (http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/) gives the following answer<br>
          (numbers are physical source lines of code):<br>
          <br>
          SLOC Directory SLOC-by-Language (Sorted)<br>
          21075 stellarlegacy cpp=20671,lex=168,yacc=164,sh=72<br>
          1565 act_to_cpp perl=1565<br>
          <br>
          Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):<br>

        <li> <strong>Where can I download SL 0.2. from?</strong><br>
          <a href="http://stellarlegacy.sourceforge.net/download.php"> http://stellarlegacy.sourceforge.net/download.php</a><br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How to compile?</strong><br>
          Yeah, right compile (did we mention this is a developer release? :-).<br>
          Please see stellarlegacy-0.2/code/stellarlegacy/README<br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Can you give some more details what 0.2 can already do?</strong><br>
          Sure :-) <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Note:</strong><br>
          the directory stellarlegacy/stellarlegacy/testgame contains all the 
          game data we are referring to in the following<br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <br>
          <li> <strong>game setup:</strong><br>
            it is possible to change the number of players, races, the size of 
            the galaxy, the number of systems. All this can be changed directly 
            in the universe-definition.sl file. <br>
            <br>
          <li> <strong>design notes:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li> SL differs between players and races (the latter are controlled 
                by the former) and it is/will be possible that one player controls 
                more than one race. 
              <li> all coordinates are 3d, 2d coordinates are achieved by setting 
                z=0 
              <li> actually it is possible to exchange the rules given in the 
                rulesystem section (and probably this will work). Unfortunately 
                there is not another set of rules yet available at the moment. 
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li><strong>game creation:</strong><br>
            starting the game ./stellarlegacy -l (&lt;- small &quot;L&quot;) creates 
            the player and the server files. At the moment these files are identical 
            (all players know everything).<br>
            <br>
          <li><strong>design notes:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li> SL shares a lot of code between objects controlled by the races 
                (such as fleets) and objects controlled by the &quot;server&quot;. 
                The server creates a special race &quot;Iluvatar&quot; which is 
                the owner of all systems etc. This makes it easily possible to 
                move systems around (non-static galaxies). 
              <li> fleets etc. have a link to the owner and the creator which 
                can be different. This will (among other things) allow races to 
                control planets with population of a different race on it. 
              <li> the galaxy can be wrapped, meaning that it is possible eliminate 
                borders &amp; corners (this feature is currently not available 
                in the game setup, but is implemented in the source). 
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li> <strong>actions / client:<br>
            </strong> by choosing &quot;play turn&quot; you can give orders to 
            your own fleets. Adding a waypoint and saving it results in a new 
            file, e.g. &quot;PlayerName-order.sl&quot;. This file contains the 
            orders the player wishes to execute. <br>
            <br>
          <li><strong> server / generate turn:</strong> <br>
            &quot;(l)oad server master file and generate turn&quot; will start 
            the server, read the servermaster file and right after that the server 
            will read all player-order files. It then creates an extra backup-directory 
            for the old game files and starts executing the actions. SL 0.2 will 
            move the fleets and the wanted direction (taking into account the 
            speed) and will even find and resolve conflicts (e.g. fleet orders 
            for A: go to B, fleet orders for B: go to A ). <br>
            <br>
          <li><strong>design notes:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li> actions are the only kind of information a player can send 
                to the server 
              <li> SL is able to detect and resolve action conflict (the current 
                testgame contains a demo) 
            </ul>
            <br><br>
        </ul>
        <li> <strong>What kind of help do you need?<br>
          </strong> Since we are still working on the guts we are most interested 
          in getting reinforcement of c++ hackers. You don't have to be an expert--an 
          important part of being part of an open source project is to improve 
          your skills. There are two areas we are currently working on: the core 
          library and the user interface (Work on the user interface is even more 
          immature than the core library).<br>
          <br>
          In short/medium-term we need support of game designers. The current 
          very flexible framework allows very different rules and we have not 
          yet decided how the SL rule set will look like. Related to this we need 
          people writing down what was agreed upon, to conserve the results for 
          the future (basic html knowledge for that would be an advantage) <br>
          <br>
          In the long-term (after 0.3) we need graphic designers and artists to 
          make SL not only cool but also beautiful. Anyway if you think SL might 
          be fun, just subscribe yourself to the mailing list and see what's going 
          on :-)<br>
          <br>
